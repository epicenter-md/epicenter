- Always use `type` instead of `interface` in Typescript.
- When moving components to new locations, always update relative imports to absolute imports (e.g., change `import Component from '../Component.svelte'` to `import Component from '$lib/components/Component.svelte'`)
- When functions are only used in the return statement of a factory/creator function, use object method shorthand syntax instead of defining them separately. For example, instead of:
  ```typescript
  function myFunction() {
    const helper = () => { /* ... */ };
    return { helper };
  }
  ```
  Use:
  ```typescript
  function myFunction() {
    return {
      helper() { /* ... */ }
    };
  }
  ```

# Standard Workflow
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to docs/specs/[timestamp] [feature-name].md where [timestamp] is the timestamp in YYYYMMDDThhmmss format and [feature-name] is the name of the feature.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the .md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.


# Human-Readable Control Flow
When refactoring complex control flow, mirror natural human reasoning patterns:

1. **Ask the human question first**: "Can I use what I already have?" → early return for happy path
2. **Assess the situation**: "What's my current state and what do I need to do?" → clear, mutually exclusive conditions  
3. **Take action**: "Get what I need" → consolidated logic at the end
4. **Use natural language variables**: `canReuseCurrentSession`, `isSameSettings`, `hasNoSession` - names that read like thoughts
5. **Avoid artificial constructs**: No nested conditions that don't match how humans actually think through problems

Transform this: nested conditionals with duplicated logic
Into this: linear flow that mirrors human decision-making

# Honesty
Be brutally honest, don't be a yes man. 
If I am wrong, point it out bluntly. 
I need honest feedback on my code.

# Shadcn-svelte Best Practices

## Component Organization
- When using $state, $derived, or functions in Svelte component files that are only referenced once in the component markup, inline them directly in the markup for better code locality
- Use the CLI for adding/managing shadcn-svelte components: `bunx shadcn-svelte@latest add [component]`
- Each component should be in its own folder under `$lib/components/ui/` with an `index.ts` export file
- Follow kebab-case for component folder names (e.g., `dialog/`, `toggle-group/`)
- Group related sub-components in the same folder (e.g., all dialog parts in `dialog/`)

## Import Patterns
Use the appropriate import pattern based on component complexity:

**Namespace imports** (preferred for multi-part components):
```typescript
import * as Dialog from '$lib/components/ui/dialog';
import * as ToggleGroup from '$lib/components/ui/toggle-group';
```

**Named imports** (for single components):
```typescript
import { Button } from '$lib/components/ui/button';
import { Input } from '$lib/components/ui/input';
```

## Styling and Customization
- Always use the `cn()` utility from `$lib/utils` for combining Tailwind classes
- Modify component code directly rather than overriding styles with complex CSS
- Use `tailwind-variants` for component variant systems
- Follow the `background`/`foreground` convention for colors
- Leverage CSS variables for theme consistency

## Component Usage Patterns
- Use proper component composition following shadcn-svelte patterns:
```svelte
<Dialog.Root bind:open={isOpen}>
  <Dialog.Trigger>
    <Button>Open</Button>
  </Dialog.Trigger>
  <Dialog.Content>
    <Dialog.Header>
      <Dialog.Title>Title</Dialog.Title>
    </Dialog.Header>
  </Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

## Custom Components
- When extending shadcn components, create wrapper components that maintain the design system
- Add JSDoc comments for complex component props
- Ensure custom components follow the same organizational patterns
- Consider semantic appropriateness (e.g., use section headers instead of cards for page sections)

# Documentation & README Writing Guidelines

## Authentic Communication Style
- Avoid emojis in headings and formal content unless explicitly requested
- Use direct, factual language over marketing speak or hyperbole
- Lead with genuine value propositions, not sales tactics
- Mirror the straightforward tone of established sections when editing
- Prefer "We built this because..." over "Revolutionary new..."

## Open Source Mindset
- Emphasize user control and data ownership
- Highlight transparency benefits (audit the code, no tracking)
- Focus on direct relationships (user → provider) over middleman models
- Present honest cost comparisons with specific, real numbers
- Acknowledge limitations and trade-offs openly

## Avoiding AI-Generated Feel

### The Dead Giveaways
- **Bold formatting everywhere** - Biggest red flag. Never bold section headers in post content
- **Excessive bullet lists** - Convert to flowing paragraphs
- **Marketing language** - "game-changing", "revolutionary", "unleash", "empower"
- **Structured sections** - "Key Features:", "Benefits:", "Why This Matters:"
- **Vague superlatives** - "incredibly powerful", "seamlessly integrates", "robust solution"

### Writing Natural Prose
- **Start with a story or problem** - "I was paying $30/month..." not "Introducing..."
- **Use specific numbers** - "$0.02/hour" not "affordable pricing"
- **Personal voice** - "I built this because..." not "This was built to..."
- **Conversational flow** - Ideas connect naturally, not in rigid sections
- **Concrete examples** - "I use it 3-4 hours daily" not "heavy usage"

### The OpenAI Post Pattern (What Works)
```
Personal hook → Specific problem → Real numbers → How I solved it → 
What it actually does → Technical details → Genuine question to community
```

### Paragraph Structure
- Mix short and long sentences
- One idea flows into the next
- No rigid formatting or sections
- Natural transitions like "So I built..." or "Here's the thing..."
- End with engagement, not a sales pitch

## README Structure Principles
- Start with what the tool actually does, not why it's amazing
- Use honest comparative language ("We believe X should be Y")
- Present facts and let users draw conclusions
- Include real limitations and use cases
- Make pricing transparent with actual provider costs

# Writing Style Examples

## Good Example (Natural, Human)
"I was paying $30/month for a transcription app. Then I did the math: the actual API calls cost about $0.36/hour. At my usage (3-4 hours/day), I was paying $30 for what should cost $3.

So I built Whispering to cut out the middleman. You bring your own API key, your audio goes directly to the provider, and you pay actual costs. No subscription, no data collection, no lock-in."

## Bad Example (AI-Generated Feel)
"**Introducing Whispering** - A revolutionary transcription solution that empowers users with unprecedented control.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Cost-Effective**: Save up to 90% on transcription costs
- **Privacy-First**: Your data never leaves your control
- **Flexible**: Multiple provider options available

**Why Whispering?** We believe transcription should be accessible to everyone..."

## The Difference
- Good: Tells a story, uses specific numbers, flows naturally
- Bad: Structured sections, bold headers, marketing language
- Good: "I built this because..." (personal)
- Bad: "This was built to..." (corporate)
- Good: "$0.02/hour" (specific)
- Bad: "affordable pricing" (vague)

# Git Commit and Pull Request Guidelines

## Conventional Commits Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types
- `feat`: New features (correlates with MINOR in semantic versioning)
- `fix`: Bug fixes (correlates with PATCH in semantic versioning)
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, etc.
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `build`: Changes to build system or dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts

### Scope Guidelines
- **Scope is OPTIONAL** - only add when it provides clarity
- Use lowercase, placed in parentheses after type: `feat(transcription):`
- Prefer specific component/module names over generic terms
- Your current practice is good: component names (`EditRecordingDialog`), feature areas (`transcription`, `sound`)
- Avoid overly generic scopes like `ui` or `backend` unless truly appropriate

### When to Use Scope
- When the change is localized to a specific component/module
- When it helps distinguish between similar changes
- When working in a large codebase with distinct areas

### When NOT to Use Scope
- When the change affects multiple areas equally
- When the type alone is sufficiently descriptive
- For small, obvious changes

### Description Rules
- Start with lowercase immediately after the colon and space
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- No period at the end
- Keep under 50-72 characters on first line

### Breaking Changes
- Add `!` after type/scope, before colon: `feat(api)!: change endpoint structure`
- Include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer with details
- These trigger MAJOR version bumps in semantic versioning

### Examples Following Your Style:
- `feat(transcription): add model selection for OpenAI providers`
- `fix(sound): resolve audio import paths in assets module`
- `refactor(EditRecordingDialog): implement working copy pattern`
- `docs(README): clarify cost comparison section`
- `chore: update dependencies to latest versions`
- `fix!: change default transcription API endpoint`

## Commit Messages Best Practices
- NEVER include Claude Code watermarks or attribution
- Each commit should represent a single, atomic change
- Write commits for future developers (including yourself)
- If you need more than one line to describe what you did, consider splitting the commit

## Pull Request Guidelines
- NEVER include Claude Code watermarks or attribution in PR titles/descriptions
- PR title should follow same conventional commit format as commits
- Focus on the "why" and "what" of changes, not the "how it was created"
- Include any breaking changes prominently
- Link to relevant issues

## What NOT to Include:
- `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)`
- `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- Any references to AI assistance
- Tool attribution or watermarks
