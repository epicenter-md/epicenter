# Yjs 14 CRDT Patterns
## Reference Repositories

- [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs): CRDT framework for shared editing and offline-first data
- [Yjs Protocols](https://github.com/yjs/y-protocols): algorithmic grounding for sync and awareness

## Upstream Grounding

When conflict semantics, transaction origins, shared-type behavior, update encoding, storage growth, or shared-type APIs affect correctness, use source-backed grounding before relying on memory. If DeepWiki MCP is available, ask a narrow question against `yjs/yjs`; for sync and awareness algorithms, ask against `yjs/y-protocols`. If DeepWiki is unavailable or the repo is not indexed, use upstream source or official docs directly. Treat DeepWiki as orientation, then verify decisive details against the locally pinned `@y/y` types and source before changing code.

Epicenter targets `@y/y` 14 only. Do not add `yjs` 13, `y-indexeddb`, a compatibility reader, a package alias, a dual wire, or a fallback. Existing Yjs 13 code is replacement material, not a compatibility surface.

Skip DeepWiki for stable basics and repo-local patterns already documented below.

Read [references/document-design.md](references/document-design.md) before
choosing how a new row document is structured. Counters, user-controlled
ordering, and nested shapes each have a conflict behavior that is expensive to
change once data exists.

Read [references/debugging.md](references/debugging.md) when a document
converges to unexpected state or grows faster than its content.

## Transactions, Origins, And Undo

- Yjs updates are commutative and idempotent. A state vector describes what a
  replica HAS; it does not order what it owes. A delete moves no client clock,
  so two replicas can hold the same vector and differ, which is why this store
  carries its own cursor and outbox rather than deriving obligation from a
  vector (`packages/data/evidence/invariants.test.ts`).
- Use `Y.encodeStateVector(doc)` to describe local clocks, then `Y.encodeStateAsUpdateV2(doc, remoteStateVector)` to send only missing updates.
- Persist and transmit bytes from the `updateV2` event. Replay them with `Y.applyUpdateV2(doc, update, origin)`.
- Wrap multi-write user actions in `doc.transact(() => { ... }, origin)`. This reduces observer churn and gives persistence, providers, and undo logic a useful origin.
- Treat transaction origins as the boundary for filtering provider echoes, app-authored operations, and undo tracking.
- Scope `Y.UndoManager` to concrete shared types. Set `trackedOrigins`, tune `captureTimeout`, and call `stopCapturing()` between logically separate commands.
- Use relative positions for collaborative cursor and selection anchors. Raw numeric indexes drift under remote edits.
- `Y.snapshot()` is a historical marker that depends on retained delete history. `Y.encodeStateAsUpdateV2(doc)` is the self-contained checkpoint format.
- Prefer separate top-level docs over Yjs subdocuments unless Epicenter owns the whole provider lifecycle for the subdoc path.

## Store Connection

- Yjs is network-agnostic. It supplies CRDT state, state vectors, updates, and awareness behavior, not Epicenter's connection topology, authorization, or durability contract.
- One socket per application, not one per open document. A replica connects to `STORE_SYNC_ROUTE.pattern` (`/api/store/v1/sync`, in `packages/sync/src/store-route.ts`) with a `namespace` naming the workspace and a `cursor` naming its own durably applied position, so a reconnect is a catch-up rather than a fresh start (ADR-0222).
- Whose data it is never appears in the query. It comes from the resolved bearer, server-side, so there is no value a client can put in the URL that reaches another partition (ADR-0092).
- Browser upgrades authenticate through exactly one `bearer.<token>` subprotocol entry, because a browser upgrade cannot set `Authorization`; the mount echoes only the main subprotocol on the 101, so the token never round-trips. Non-browser clients may use an `Authorization` header. Do not use cookie-only upgrades, query-string credentials, or post-accept authentication frames.
- The wire is framing and nothing else: `push`, `ack`, `refuse`, `entry`, `offer`, `snapshot`, `wanted` (`packages/data/src/sync/frames.ts`). No frame knows what an update means, what a row is, or what Yjs is, which is exactly why chunking is safe at that layer.
- Large updates are chunked at `CHUNK_BYTES`, set by Cloudflare's documented Durable Object SQLite value cap rather than by anything about Yjs. Do not raise it to the measured wall; the documented limit is the one Cloudflare is entitled to enforce.
- Presence is deliberately absent until a concrete consumer earns awareness state and disconnect cleanup. If added later, awareness is ephemeral and must never be persisted into the Y.Doc or the SQLite update log as canonical data.

## One Document Per Application

An application is ONE `Y.Doc`. Roots are `tables:<name>` and `kv`. A row is a
nested `Y.Type` attribute on its table root, a scalar field is a JSON attribute
on the row, and the content node is a nested `Y.Type` at the row's reserved
`content` key (ADR-0295, ADR-0299). Holding the attribute is what it means to exist; removing it is what
deletion does, and it reclaims the row's whole subtree in one operation.

The nesting is not stylistic. `Item.write` calls `findRootTypeKey`, a linear
scan of `doc.share`, so one root per row makes encoding quadratic in rows
(5,417 ms for 20,000 rows against 13 ms nested).

There are no independent row documents. A row's prose used to live in its own
top-level document at a derived address, with a document manager, a tombstone
table and an `openDocument` verb (ADR-0248); ADR-0295 collapsed all of it into
the row. Advice naming `documents.ts`, `openDocument`, `_tombstones`, or
"hydrate the row's document" is describing a design that no longer exists.

```typescript
// Scalars are attributes on the row, written through the table.
db.tables.notes.update(noteId, { title, pinned: true });

// The content node is ON the row, read synchronously with everything else.
const note = db.tables.notes.get(noteId);
const body = note?.content;           // a live Y.Type an editor binds to
```

Inside the application document only `Doc.get` mints, and every key reaching it
must be a table name the database declares: reading an unknown ROW through
`getAttr` costs nothing, while a misspelled TABLE name costs a permanent root.

## Two Signals, And Which One Fires

- `table.subscribe` fires when a table's SHAPE changes: a row added, removed,
  or a scalar edited. It does NOT fire for an edit inside a content node.
- `table.watch(node)` fires for edits inside one content node, keyed by the
  node's own identity.

The distinction is forced by the library. Delivery routes off
`transaction.changed`, which Yjs fills with the types a transaction modified
DIRECTLY, so a keystroke in a body puts the BODY's type there; its parent is
the row, not the table root. Nothing bubbles to the table. A surface that
watches a table for prose changes sees nothing.

## Owner-Side Persistence

One document, so one chain: `_updates (id, bytes, authoritySeq)` in SQLite, and
the matching object store in the browser's IndexedDB. There is no per-document
partition, no `_tombstones`, and no separate `_outbox` — what a replica still
owes is the rows with `authoritySeq IS NULL`, which is a partial index rather
than a second table (ADR-0238). Do not add a separate IndexedDB provider or a
second document store.

- Hydrate BEFORE attaching the `updateV2` listener. Replaying stored bytes
  through the listener would re-append them; the engine applies its history
  first and then attaches, and throws if a foreign apply ever reaches the
  listener, so a mistake here fails the open loudly rather than duplicating a
  log (`packages/data/src/store/store.ts`).
- A locally authored append joins the durable queue owed. Authority-accepted
  bytes arrive on a remote origin and create no outbound obligation, which is
  what the one listener checks before appending.
- The chain folds at `SNAPSHOT_FOLD_THRESHOLD` by replaying into a fresh
  `gc: true` document and rewriting it as one complete V2 state update. Replay
  rather than `mergeUpdatesV2`, because merging does not GC and collapsing
  tombstones is the point. `encodeStateAsUpdateV2` folds buffered pending state
  back into its output, so a fold taken while dependencies are missing cannot
  silently drop them.
- Treat replay corruption as storage failure: a document that cannot hydrate refuses its open rather than handing out a half-hydrated handle.

## Storage Optimization

v14 has ONE shared type, `Y.Type`, reached as `doc.get(name)` for a map-like
root or `doc.get(name, 'text')` for a text one. There is no `Y.Map`, `Y.Text`,
`Y.Array` or `Y.XmlFragment`; code or advice naming them is Yjs 13 and is
replacement material.

Attribute tombstones retain the key forever, and every `setAttr(key, value)`
creates a new internal item and tombstones the previous one, which is why
`gc: true` is what collapses a field edited 5,000 times down to two structs.

## Raw Types At The Boundary

A `Y.Type` handed out by a table handle is a live CRDT reference and is MEANT
to be bound to an editor. That is the design: the store hands the editor the
real thing rather than proxying it, because a copy would break the merge that
makes it worth having.

What does not belong in a feature:

- **Constructing the layout.** A feature does not decide which attribute a row
  keeps its prose under. It asks the table for the row and reads the declared
  field.
- **Casting into shape.** `as Y.Type` outside `packages/data/src/store/` means
  something is reading a document the store owns without going through it.
- **Reaching the document.** `doc.get(...)` in a feature bypasses the
  declaration, the conformance lens, and the durable queue at once.

The store's own boundary is `packages/data/src/store/document.ts`: it holds one
cast, at `rowType`, and states why (a container whose attributes are themselves
types has no expressible configuration, so a table root stays untyped while a
ROW's shape is declared). Everything downstream of that line is typed.
