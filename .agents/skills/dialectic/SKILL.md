# Dialectic

A dialectic is the deliberate collision of concrete articulations. Someone
arrives with a half-formed thing they cannot say, and says it badly anyway. The
agent returns something confident and specific, and it is wrong in a way that
can be pointed at. The pointing is the mechanism: the user finds out what they
meant by having something particular in front of them to be annoyed by. Through
repeated re-articulation the model becomes intelligible, or produces an account
the user can recognize and say, in effect, “that’s right.”

The user's job is to react: recognize the account, say it back in their own
words, or point at the part that is off. Everything that is not reacting belongs
to the agent, including the guessing, the choosing, the concluding, the
assuming, and the resolving.

Every turn must leave the live articulation or articulations visible. Make the
main surface the articulation itself: a particular situation rendered closely
enough that the user can point at what is wrong with it. A block quote is often
the right surface, but it may contain prose, an ASCII diagram, code, or another
direct rendering when that makes the vision whole. It may be as expansive as the
vision requires, but leave the user's words entirely: do not return their own
material to them in better grammar, go to the situation their words were about.
The surface carries no history of how it was reached, no evidence collection,
and no explanation of the answer. Do not announce it with self-referential
labels such as “my current model” or narrate the path that produced it. When
multiple accounts are live, keep them distinct rather than flattening them into
a summary. The user should be able to accept, reject, or correct the account
itself.

## What an articulation is

An articulation is a rendering the user can stand inside and be specifically
wrong about. It may describe what exists or propose what should exist; that
difference is secondary. What matters is that it is particular enough to be
pointed at. Keep the model whole and allow it to be deliberately oversimplified.
It is complete in meaning but does not need to be justified before it is
offered. It is not a preference label, an implementation option, or a softened
summary that hides the disagreement.

For the first, the vision must be enterable, not merely defensible. Render what
it would be like to inhabit the whole: what the person is trying to do, what
they encounter, what they can now decide or accomplish, and what the system
carries for them. For the second, show the thing and say what it does, as
[example-turn.html](references/example-turn.html) does.

Reaching that concreteness means inventing material the user never supplied.
Invent it without hedging, then name the two or three places it came from
nothing. Those are where the user's reaction is worth the most, because they are
where the agent had least to go on. Uncertainty never appears inside the
articulation; it appears after it, as a short line saying what was filled in and
what would collapse if the guess is wrong.

The agent should make its strongest account, not wait for certainty. A wrong
articulation is useful because the user's reaction supplies the next evidence.
Use history, explanation, and evidence to expose the account's pressure
points, not to finish defending it before the collision begins.

Read one when the interaction itself needs calibration.

vision being built through successive re-articulations.
[example-turn.html](references/example-turn.html) shows one turn's shape: the
claim first, the artifact rendered as itself, two live articulations, one
question, and the assumption behind the recommendation named at the end. They
are reference interactions, not templates or scripts.

## Make the next move

Before the first turn, identify the live uncertainty that makes the next
judgment difficult. Expose the strongest account the agent can currently make,
including what it implies, what it refuses, and what would prove it inadequate.
Do not replace that account with a history of how the evidence was collected.

Offer multiple articulations when their collision is necessary to expose the
crux or when the agent cannot responsibly choose among materially different
accounts. Make each one strong enough to collide with. They are objects of
comparison, not a menu that gives the synthesis work back to the user. When
one account is stronger overall, say so without pretending the question is
settled.

Vary them by where the person is standing and what they are trying to find out,
never by which mechanism fires. Options that differ by a capability never left
the implementation: the user reads them and has no reaction, because neither one
is about them. Enumerating what the system could do is the easy move and it
produces the weak pair. Ask instead where someone would be, and what they would
be after, at the moment this matters.

Treat inherited implementation, prior plans, and existing design as evidence to
inspect, not authority to obey. Push through the user's initial framing by
articulating what it implies, what it leaves unresolved, and what stronger
account it may point toward. External facts and explicit user constraints
remain real inputs; surface a conflict with them instead of quietly
compromising.

Each turn should advance the highest-order unresolved crux. Choose the reaction
that would most change the model, then put up the strongest account that could
make that reaction possible. One turn may contain several related
articulations, but it should make the collision that matters most inspectable.

A turn advances when it sharpens an articulation, replaces one, changes its
boundary or consequences, or resolves the crux. If it only adds explanation
without changing what is being judged, it has not moved the dialectic.

The conversation moves like this:

```txt
articulations
  -> collision of premises and consequences
  -> user reaction as directional evidence
  -> crux and required movement identified
  -> targeted question, consequence, or refusal
  -> sharper re-articulation
  -> understanding or accepted destination
```

Read the user’s reaction as directional evidence about the model and its crux,
not as a command to obey at face value. Preserve what the user recognized,
replace what they rejected, intensify what they cared about more strongly than
the last model showed, and re-articulate in the direction their reaction
indicates. The reaction is not merely a verdict on the last articulation; it
shows how the model must move. When local collisions recur, zoom out to the
shared premise and re-articulate it. An unexpected tangent may show that the
frame itself is no longer necessary.

When the user cannot explain a reaction, name the objection they could not
name. This is the second half of the loop, not a courtesy for an edge case: a
reaction that stays inarticulate cannot move the account, so the agent states
the mismatch or crux it may be pointing toward and lets the user react to that
instead. The naming exists to unblock the next articulation, not to make the
user feel heard, and the turn is finished when the vision has moved, not when
the objection is named.

When the user returns a sentence, answer its accuracy first and name the word
or premise carrying the divergence. When they give an example, use it to update
the model. Plain agreement is useful only when it moves the model forward.

The user's reaction may be meandering, repetitive, partial, or uncertain. Do
not mirror that shape. Extract the directional evidence, identify the crux, and
respond with the tightest account that preserves the concreteness of the next
articulation. Tightness means removing conversational processing, not shrinking
the vision.

## Make the collision checkable

State the whole articulation first, then render enough of the situation for the
user to enter it and react to what is actually being claimed. Choose
the surface from the subject: show the lived sequence or concrete interaction
for a workflow or product, proposed code or structural shape for architecture
or code, and the direct representation that makes another kind of model
inspectable. Do not substitute a generic principle, an inventory of system
objects, or a retrospective explanation for the vision. After the articulation,
add only what the next reaction needs, and end with one question at most: one
thing the user has to form an opinion about before they can answer. Consequences,
refusals, and invented edges are not questions, since they cost nothing to read
and need a response only when they are wrong. A crux, a claim offered for
judgment, and a set of options are each one question. Everything else the agent
wanted to ask becomes something it decided and disclosed as an invented edge. If
the articulation is sufficient, ask nothing.

Use a comparison when distinct articulations are live, and research when a fact could
change the model. Use a diagram, HTML page, or prototype only when the spatial
or behavioral relationship is materially easier to judge that way. If HTML is
the right surface, read [references/example-turn.html](references/example-turn.html)
before writing it and keep it self-contained with inline CSS and JavaScript.

## How it ends

When the user is trying to understand, stop when they understand the model well
enough to reason about it. Do not manufacture an accepted articulation or ask
the user to restate one merely to prove comprehension.

When the user is correcting or designing, do not stop at a plausible model,
partial agreement, silence, fatigue, or approval of a plan. Stop when the user
recognizes the complete articulation and says, in effect, “that’s right.”

Then stop. Return its shortest honest form and nothing after it. Do not produce
a remaining question, a next decision, or a small unowned thing to justify one
more turn. Anything genuinely unresolved was raised while it mattered, not
harvested at the end. Recognition is not authorization for a merge, deletion,
implementation, or other side effect.

For an accepted destination, hand it to
[greenfield-clean-breaks](../greenfield-clean-breaks/SKILL.md) for backward
planning. For implementation, carry out the accepted destination without
turning implementation details into new product decisions. If implementation
reveals a fact that changes the destination, return to the dialectic.

A dialectic is not a standalone lesson. When the material is settled and the
user wants a self-contained explanation rather than to inspect the agent’s
model, hand it to [teaching-page](../teaching-page/SKILL.md).
