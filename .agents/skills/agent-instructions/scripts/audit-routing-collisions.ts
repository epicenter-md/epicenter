/**
 * Report every skill description that mentions one trigger phrase.
 *
 * The `phrase -> skill/SKILL.md` line format and the exit codes are the
 * contract `references/composition-audit.md` documents; do not change them.
 *
 * It counts claimants rather than mentions because resolving a contested
 * phrase *creates* a second mention. The fix for two skills claiming
 * "simplify this" is for one of them to say "use collapse-pass instead", and a
 * detector counting mentions would call that resolved state a collision, which
 * teaches the reader to ignore its exit code. Every mention is still listed:
 * knowing who routes a phrase away is most of why you ran this.
 *
 * `--explain` annotates each line with `[claims]` or `[disclaims]`. It only
 * surfaces the classification the verdict already runs on, so it cannot change
 * a result.
 *
 * Always-on hits are reported additively, on stderr, because a skill
 * description is not the only thing that routes. `AGENTS.md` loads before any
 * description is weighed and names skills outright, and a live probe obeys it:
 * an `AGENTS.md` sentence sending overflow reports to `documentation` beat
 * `styling`'s own description 3 times out of 3. A phrase claimed by one
 * description and by `AGENTS.md` has two claimants while this script counts
 * one, which is exactly the collision it exists to catch. The report goes to
 * stderr so the stdout contract above is untouched.
