# Why You Can't Get the Caller's File Path in JavaScript

I needed to know where a `workspace.config.ts` file was located. Not where my helper function lives, but where the config file that's importing my helper is actually sitting on disk.

This should be simple, right? But JavaScript doesn't give you this.

## The Problem: There's No "Caller Path" in JavaScript

When you write a library or framework that loads config files, you often want to know: "Where is this config file located?" This matters for things like:

- Resolving relative paths in the config
- Creating storage directories next to the config
- Loading assets relative to the config

But here's the thing: **JavaScript has no way to get the caller's file path from inside a function.**

## What We Have: import.meta.dirname

`import.meta.dirname` exists, and it gives you the directory of the current file:

```typescript
// helpers/workspace-factory.ts
export function createWorkspace() {
  console.log(import.meta.dirname);
  // Always prints: /project/helpers/
  // Even when called from workspace-one/workspace.config.ts!
}
```

The problem? It's not lazy. It evaluates immediately where it's written, not where it's called from.

## Why This Fails

Here's what I wanted to do:

```typescript
// helpers/workspace-factory.ts
export function createWorkspace(id: string) {
  return defineWorkspace({
    id,
    baseDir: import.meta.dirname, // ❌ This is helpers/, not the caller's dir!
  });
}

// workspace-one/workspace.config.ts
export default createWorkspace('workspace-one');
// I want baseDir to be workspace-one/, but it's helpers/
```

`import.meta.dirname` is evaluated when the module loads, not when the function runs. So it always captures the helper's location, never the caller's.

## Why JavaScript Can't Do This

Unlike some languages that have stack introspection or caller information, JavaScript deliberately doesn't expose this. The module system doesn't track "who imported me" or "who called this function."

You can't:
- Pass `import.meta.dirname` as a function reference
- Call it lazily to get the caller's path
- Use stack traces reliably (especially after bundling)

## The Only Solution: Explicit Capture

The caller must explicitly provide their own location:

```typescript
// workspace-one/workspace.config.ts
export default defineWorkspace({
  id: 'workspace-one',
  baseDir: import.meta.dirname, // ✅ Must be written HERE
});
```

This feels redundant ("why can't the framework figure this out?"), but it's the only reliable way.

## Why It Has To Be This Way

The moment you abstract `import.meta.dirname` into a function, you lose the caller's location:

```typescript
// ❌ Can't abstract it away
function getMyDir() {
  return import.meta.dirname; // Returns getMyDir's location, not caller's
}

// ❌ Can't pass it as reference
const dirGetter = import.meta.dirname; // Just a string, not a function

// ✅ Must inline it
const myDir = import.meta.dirname; // Only way to get YOUR file's location
```

## Workarounds That Don't Work

### "Just use process.cwd()"
That gives you where the user ran the command, not where the config file is.

### "Parse import.meta.url"
This works but requires more code than just using `import.meta.dirname`:

```typescript
// Verbose
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';
import { dirname } from 'node:path';
const __dirname = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));

// vs. just using dirname
const __dirname = import.meta.dirname;
```

### "Use a build tool to inject it"
Fragile and breaks in development.

## The Takeaway

When you need to know where a config file is located, the config file itself must capture that information using `import.meta.dirname`. No helper function or framework can magically figure it out for you.

This is a JavaScript limitation, not a framework limitation.

```typescript
// This is the pattern
export default defineWorkspace({
  baseDir: import.meta.dirname, // Explicit, but necessary
  // ...
});
```

It's one extra line, but it's the only reliable way to tell the framework "I'm sitting in this directory."
