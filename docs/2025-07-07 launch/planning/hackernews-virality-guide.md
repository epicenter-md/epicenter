# Hacker News Virality Guide

## What Makes HN Titles Go Viral

### The Psychology of HN Readers
- They're skeptical of marketing speak
- They value technical substance
- They appreciate honesty and humility
- They love David vs Goliath stories
- They respond to concrete specifics over vague claims

### Title Patterns That Work

**1. The Specific Technical Achievement**
- "Show HN: I made a X that does Y using Z"
- Concrete, measurable, technical
- Examples that would work:
  - "Show HN: Open-source transcription that costs $0.02/hour instead of $30/month"
  - "Show HN: Desktop transcription app in 50MB using Svelte 5 + Tauri"

**2. The Problem/Solution**
- States a clear problem people relate to
- Examples:
  - "Show HN: Transcription apps charge $30/month for API wrappers. I made a free alternative"
  - "Show HN: I was paying $30/month for transcription. Now I pay $0.02/hour"

**3. The Technical Deep Dive**
- Appeals to HN's love of technical details
- Examples:
  - "Show HN: Production Svelte 5 app with real-time audio processing"
  - "Show HN: How I built cross-platform transcription with Tauri in 50MB"

**4. The Philosophical Stand**
- Takes a position HN agrees with
- Examples:
  - "Show HN: Transcription should be free. Here's my open-source alternative"
  - "Show HN: Why I open-sourced my transcription app instead of charging $30/month"

### Title Elements That Kill Virality
- ❌ Buzzwords: "revolutionary", "game-changing", "disrupting"
- ❌ Vague claims: "better", "faster", "easier"
- ❌ Marketing speak: "powerful", "seamless", "cutting-edge"
- ❌ Name-dropping without substance: "built with AI"
- ❌ Asking for upvotes or feedback in title

### The Magic Formula

**Structure**: [Hook] + [Specific Achievement] + [Technical Credibility]

The best HN titles have:
1. **Specificity**: Exact numbers, technologies, or comparisons
2. **Humility**: "I made" not "Revolutionary new"
3. **Technical meat**: Mention the stack or approach
4. **Clear value**: What problem does it solve?

## Optimized Title Options for Whispering

### Tier 1 (Highest Viral Potential)

**"Show HN: Open-source transcription app that costs $0.02/hour instead of $30/month"**
- Specific numbers create immediate value comparison
- "Open-source" signals HN values
- Clear David vs Goliath narrative

**"Show HN: I made a 50MB transcription app with Svelte 5 + Tauri (free, your API keys)"**
- Technical achievement (50MB is impressive)
- Specific stack appeals to developers
- "Your API keys" hints at privacy/ownership

**"Show HN: Transcription apps charge $30/month for API wrappers. Here's my free alternative"**
- Problem statement HN relates to
- Positions you as solving real issue
- "Free alternative" is compelling

### Tier 2 (Strong Contenders)

**"Show HN: Free transcription app where you bring your own API key (Svelte 5 + Tauri)"**
- Clear value prop
- Technical credibility
- Missing specific comparison

**"Show HN: Why I open-sourced my transcription app after seeing competitors' pricing"**
- Story-driven
- Philosophical angle
- Might be too soft for HN

**"Show HN: Desktop transcription in 50MB - no servers, no subscriptions, just your API key"**
- Technical achievement
- Clear benefits
- Good rhythm

### The Winner (My Recommendation)

**"Show HN: Open-source transcription app that costs $0.02/hour instead of $30/month"**

Why this works:
1. **Immediate value clarity**: Anyone can calculate the 99.9% savings
2. **Specific numbers**: HN loves concrete comparisons
3. **"Open-source"**: Signals your values align with HN
4. **Problem/solution**: Implicitly states the problem (overpriced apps)
5. **No fluff**: Direct, honest, substantive

### Post Content Optimization

Your current content is good, but here's how to make it more viral:

**Opening Hook Enhancement:**
```
I built Whispering after discovering transcription apps charge $30/month for what costs $0.02/hour in API fees. That's a 1,500x markup for being a middleman.
```

**Add Concrete Metrics:**
```
Performance stats:
- Lightweight bundle (~22MB on macOS) vs competitors' several hundred MB Electron apps
- <100MB RAM usage
- Instant cold start
- Direct API calls (no proxy latency)
```

**Technical Deep Dive Teaser:**
```
Technical highlights for the curious:
- First production app using Svelte 5's new runes system extensively
- Tauri's native APIs for secure key storage
- Real-time waveform rendering without killing performance
- Cross-platform audio handling that actually works
```

## First Comment Strategy

Prepare a first comment that adds value:

```
For context on the pricing: I've been using this daily for 6 months, averaging 3-4 hours of transcription per day. My total cost? About $2-5/month going directly to Groq/OpenAI.

The competitors charging $30/month are literally just proxying these same API calls.

Happy to dive into any technical details - the Svelte 5 patterns for handling real-time audio streams were particularly interesting to figure out.
```

## Timing for Maximum Impact

- Post at 7-9 AM PST (peak HN traffic)
- Avoid Fridays (lower engagement)
- Monday-Wednesday optimal
- Have 2-3 technical friends ready to engage early (not upvote - engage with substantive comments)

## Response Strategy

When people inevitably ask:
- "Why not just use X?" → Have specific feature comparisons ready
- "How is this different?" → Focus on philosophy + concrete benefits
- "Technical details?" → Go deep, HN loves technical depth

Remember: HN can smell marketing from a mile away. Be genuine, technical, and let the value speak for itself.
