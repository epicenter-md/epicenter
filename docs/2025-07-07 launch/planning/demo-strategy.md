# Demo Video Strategy for Launch

## Existing Demo Video
Location: `/videos/2025-07-06 Demo/`
- Total demo segments: 7 videos
- Key segments: Vibe Coding Demo (74s), Whispering Configuration (40s)
- Shows: Whispering + Claude Code workflow

## Launch Strategy Recommendation

### Option 1: Same Post with Demo (RECOMMENDED)
**Pros:**
- Shows immediate value - "here's what you can do with it"
- Demonstrates real use case with Claude Code
- More engaging for visual platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn)
- Higher chance of going viral with compelling demo

**Best for:**
- Twitter/X - Include GIF snippets in main thread
- LinkedIn - Embed video in post
- ProductHunt - Add as gallery item
- Reddit (where video is supported)

**Example approach:**
```
"Transcription should be free. I built Whispering as a free alternative to paid apps.

Here's me using it with Claude Code to code faster than typing: [video/gif]

Bring your own API key, pay cents not dollars."
```

### Option 2: Separate Posts
**Pros:**
- Two chances to get attention
- Can target different audiences (general vs developers)
- Follow-up content keeps momentum

**Best for:**
- Hacker News - Text-only initial post, demo in comments if asked
- Technical subreddits - Follow up with "Here's how I use it" post

**Timeline:**
- Day 1: Main launch
- Day 2-3: "Show HN: Using Whispering + Claude Code for faster development"

## Platform-Specific Demo Usage

### Video-Friendly Platforms
- **Twitter/X**: 30-second highlight reel or GIF
- **LinkedIn**: Full 2-3 minute demo
- **ProductHunt**: Gallery with screenshots + video
- **r/programming**: Link to video in post

### Text-First Platforms  
- **Hacker News**: Mention in post, link if requested
- **r/sveltejs**: Technical post, demo shows Svelte 5 in action
- **Discord**: Share video directly in announcement

## Demo Preparation Tasks
- [ ] Create 30-second highlight reel from existing segments
- [ ] Extract key GIFs (configuration, vibe coding moment)
- [ ] Create screenshots for static platforms
- [ ] Write video description focusing on speed improvement

## Key Messaging with Demo
"See how I code 3x faster using voice with Whispering + Claude Code"
"From thought to code in seconds - no $15/month subscription required"
"Why pay for transcription when you can bring your own API key?"

## Recommended Approach
1. **Lead with demo on visual platforms** (Twitter, LinkedIn, ProductHunt)
2. **Text-first on technical platforms** (HN, technical subreddits)
3. **Have demo ready for comments** when people ask "how does it work?"
4. **Create follow-up posts** showing specific workflows (2-3 days after launch)
