**Platform**: YouTube Shorts (Public)

**Finalized Description**:
```
Watch how I use voice to code faster than typing with Whispering (free, open source) + Claude Code. This setup costs me $0.02/hour and has completely changed how I write code.

GitHub: https://github.com/braden-w/whispering

In this demo:
- Real-time voice coding with Whispering
- Integration with Claude Code
- Hands-free development workflow
- Building features by talking through them

My setup:
- Whispering for transcription (free app, $0.02/hr with Groq)
- Claude Code for AI assistance
- Voice-activated mode for hands-free coding

Why voice coding?
- Faster for boilerplate and documentation
- Natural for explaining complex logic
- Reduces typing fatigue/RSI
- Better flow state when thinking out loud

Whispering is 100% free and open source. You bring your own API key and pay providers directly - no $30/month subscriptions.

Try it yourself:
- Download: https://github.com/braden-w/whispering/releases
- Setup guide: [5-min YouTube video link]

Built with love for developers who want to code faster and type less.

## SEO Optimization

**YouTube Titles** (for discoverability):
- Include "Open Source" and "Free"
- Mention competitors indirectly: "Alternative to Paid Transcription Apps"
- Use numbers: "Save $300/year" or "$0.02/hour"

**Video Descriptions** should include:
- Link to GitHub in first line
- Timestamps for navigation
- Keywords: transcription, voice to text, open source, free
- Call to action: "Star on GitHub if helpful!"

2. **Secondary**: GitHub Releases (for archival)
3. **Launch-specific**: Native platform uploads (Twitter, LinkedIn)

Never rely on a single host - always have backups!
