Hey Svelte community! ðŸŽ‰

Just launched **Whispering** - a free, open-source transcription app built with Svelte 5!

**Svelte 5 features used:**
- Runes throughout ($state, $derived, $effect)
- Component composition patterns
- Reactive audio visualization
- Cross-window state management

**What it does:**
Transcription using your own API keys. No subscriptions, just bring your OpenAI/Groq key and pay cents for hours of transcription.

**Tech stack:**
- Svelte 5 + TypeScript
- Tauri for desktop
- shadcn-svelte components

It's one of the more complex Svelte 5 apps in the wild - great for learning modern patterns!

Would love your feedback! Happy to discuss any Svelte 5 implementation details ðŸš€
