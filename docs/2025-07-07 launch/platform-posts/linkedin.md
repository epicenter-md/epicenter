As an open-source developer, maintaining productivity while managing code refactors, issue tracking, and documentation is critical. 

Here's the workflow I use to code hands-free:

- Run 3‚Äì6 Claude Code agents in parallel (more recently `opencode`)
- Transcribe voice ‚Üí prompts with Whispering (2¬¢/hr)  
- Clip-on mic for roam-and-riff idea capture
- One pipeline for emails, docs, blog drafts‚Äîeven posts

I speak my thoughts while walking, cooking, or just thinking out loud. The transcription happens on my machine, costs pennies per hour, and integrates seamlessly with my development environment.

This way, I'm able to parallelize verbal instructions, capture ideas instantly without context switching, turn conversations into documentation in real-time, and keep coding even when away from the keyboard.

I built Whispering as a free, open-source alternative to transcription services that cost $30 per month. You bring your own API key and pay actual costs‚Äîno middleman, no data collection, no subscriptions. Use it if you want!
