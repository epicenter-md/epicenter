Free, open-source transcription app - because accessibility tools shouldn't have paywalls

## Post Content

Hi r/accessibility,

I built Whispering, a completely free and open-source transcription application, because I believe accessibility tools should be available to everyone without financial barriers.

**Why this matters for accessibility:**
- No subscription fees or usage limits
- Works offline after initial setup
- Customizable for different needs
- Keyboard shortcuts for hands-free operation
- Clear, high-contrast UI

**Key features:**
- Real-time transcription
- Multiple language support
- Export in various formats (TXT, SRT, JSON)
- Adjustable transcription accuracy
- Works with any audio input device

**Technical approach:**
You bring your own API key (OpenAI Whisper, Groq, etc.), which means:
- You pay only cents for hours of transcription
- No middleman service that could shut down
- Full control over your data

**Use cases I've seen:**
- Note-taking for students with disabilities
- Meeting transcription for deaf/hard of hearing professionals
- Voice journaling for those with motor impairments
- Content creation with accurate captions

The app is built with Svelte 5 + Tauri and runs natively on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

I'd love feedback from the accessibility community on how to make this tool even more useful. What features would help most?
