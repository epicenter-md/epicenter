### Tweet 2 (The Reveal + GitHub Link)
For my workflow, I use Whispering: a completely free, open-source transcription tool.

GitHub: https://github.com/braden-w/whispering#readme

### Tweet 4 (Technical Details + Setup Guide)
Built with:
- @sveltejs 5 (runes)
- @tauri_apps (lightweight native app)
- @tan_stack Query (reactive state)
- TypeScript + Rust

No servers. No tracking. Just your voice â†’ your code.
