Hey Claude Code / opencode users!

I posted a quick guide on [Bookface](https://bookface.ycombinator.com/posts/91940) for how I use Claude Code. Split terminal + voice-activated dictation is really powerful if you're trying to 10x your productivity!

Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think! Also, what are your current setups now? I've started using [opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) today and really love it (plugs into my Max subscription and moves faster than CC).
