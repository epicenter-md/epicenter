# Blog Post: Introducing Whispering - Why I Built a Free Alternative to Paid Transcription Apps

## TL;DR
I built Whispering, a completely free and open-source transcription app, because I believe essential productivity tools shouldn't cost paidnth. Bring your own API key, own your data, pay only for what you use.

## The Accidental Alternative

I've been building Whispering for months, using it daily for multiple hours. It started as a personal tool - I needed reliable transcription for my workflow and decided to build exactly what I wanted. Clean, fast, private.

Then I discovered something that genuinely surprised me: companies were charging substantial monthly fees for essentially the same thing.

For transcription. A fundamental tool that's just an API wrapper.

## Why Transcription Should Be Free

Here's what bothers me: these apps are charging premium prices for acting as middlemen to APIs you could access yourself. They're gatekeeping a basic productivity tool behind subscription paywalls.

Transcription isn't a luxury feature. It's essential for:
- Accessibility
- Note-taking
- Content creation
- Language learning
- Productivity

When we paywall these tools, we're limiting who can benefit from them.

## The Whispering Approach

Whispering takes a different philosophy:

**1. You Own Everything**
- Bring your own API key (OpenAI Whisper, Groq, etc.)
- Your audio goes directly to the service
- No servers, no middlemen, no data collection

**2. Pay for What You Use**
- API costs are typically cents, not dollars
- No monthly subscriptions eating away at your budget
- Complete transparency in what you're paying for

**3. Open Source Everything**
- Every line of code is public
- Audit it yourself
- Contribute improvements
- Fork it if you want

**4. Privacy First**
- Your transcriptions stay yours
- No analytics, no tracking
- Direct API communication only

## Built with Modern Tech

For the technically curious, Whispering showcases what's possible with modern web technologies:
- **Svelte 5**: One of the first production apps using the new runes system
- **Tauri**: Native performance without Electron's bloat
- **TypeScript**: Type safety throughout
- **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux

The codebase follows modern best practices and serves as a learning resource for developers interested in building desktop apps with web technologies.

## A Different Kind of Competition

I respect what paid transcription apps have built. They're polished products with dedicated teams. But I fundamentally disagree with their business model.

Essential tools should be:
- Accessible to everyone
- Transparent in operation
- Free from artificial limitations
- Community-driven

Whispering isn't trying to compete on features or polish. It's offering a different philosophy: transcription as a public good, not a premium service.

## Join the Movement

If you believe in:
- Open source software
- Data ownership
- Accessible tools
- Community over corporations
