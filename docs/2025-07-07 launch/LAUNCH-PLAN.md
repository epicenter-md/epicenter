## Response Templates

### Common Questions

**"How is this different from [competitor]?"**
> The main difference is philosophy. Whispering is 100% free and open source. You bring your own API key, so you pay cents directly to providers instead of monthly subscriptions. Your data never touches our servers.

**"What's the catch?"**
> No catch. I built this for myself and use it daily. I believe essential tools should be free and transparent. The code is open source so you can verify everything yourself.

**"Technical stack?"**
> Built with Svelte 5 (using new runes) + Tauri for native performance. Lightweight bundle (~22MB on macOS), instant startup, low memory usage. The codebase showcases modern patterns and is great for learning.

## Success Metrics
