# V7.0.0 Release Notes Improvement Plan

## Current Issues with Release Notes

1. **Too technical and developer-focused** - Starts with architecture rewrite instead of user benefits
2. **Buried download CTA** - "Download v7.0.0 today!" is at the very bottom
3. **Overwhelming information** - Too many technical details that don't drive downloads
4. **Missing clear installation instructions** - No direct links or guidance on how to get started
5. **Lacks excitement** - Doesn't capture the "wow" factor of the improvements

## Goals

1. **Drive downloads** - Make it immediately clear how to download and install
2. **Lead with user benefits** - What's in it for them, not how we built it
3. **Create urgency** - Why they should download NOW
4. **Simplify** - Focus on key improvements that matter to users
5. **Two versions** - Quick version for casual users, detailed version for power users

## Proposed Structure

### Version 1: Quick Release (For GitHub Releases Page)
- **Download section first** - Platform-specific download links
- **3-5 key improvements** - What users will notice immediately
- **Quick start guide** - Get transcribing in 2 minutes
- **Link to detailed notes** - "Read the full technical changelog â†’"

### Version 2: Detailed Release (Linked from quick version)
- **User improvements section** - Expanded benefits
- **Technical improvements** - For developers and power users
- **Migration guide** - For existing users
- **Full changelog** - Complete list of changes

## Key Messages to Emphasize

1. **It's faster** - Instant UI updates, smarter caching
2. **It's more reliable** - Better error handling, automatic retries
3. **It's easier to use** - Redesigned settings, visual shortcut recorder
4. **It's still free** - Open source, bring your own API keys
5. **It's future-proof** - Ready for upcoming features

## Todo Items

- [x] Write Version 1: Quick release notes focused on downloads
- [x] Write Version 2: Detailed technical changelog
- [x] Create clear download section with platform detection
- [x] Add "What's New" section with user-focused benefits
- [x] Include migration notes for existing users
- [ ] Add visual elements (screenshots/GIFs if available)
- [x] Test both versions for clarity and engagement
