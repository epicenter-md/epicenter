# Technical Specifications

This directory contains technical specifications and implementation plans created during feature development.

## Purpose

The specs folder serves as a workspace for planning and documenting features before and during implementation. These documents:

- Capture the initial thinking and planning for features
- Provide a structured approach to complex implementations
- Create a historical record of design decisions
- Help maintain context when revisiting code in the future

## Workflow

1. **Creation**: When starting a significant feature, create a spec document with the format:
   ```
   [timestamp]-[feature-name].md
   ```
   Where timestamp is in `YYYYMMDDThhmmss` format

2. **Usage**: The spec typically includes:
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed solution
   - Implementation plan with todo items
   - Technical considerations
   - Review/summary of changes made

3. **Lifecycle**:
   - Specs are committed alongside major features
   - They provide valuable context in git history
   - May be periodically cleaned up, but often kept for reference
   - Particularly useful when understanding why certain decisions were made

## Note

This is a working directory - not all features require specs, and the level of detail varies based on complexity. The primary value is in capturing the "why" behind implementations for future reference.
