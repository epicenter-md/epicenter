# Context: shared vocabulary

The words Epicenter uses for its own concepts, so humans and agents name the same
thing the same way. Keep entries to one or two lines. When a design pass coins or
sharpens a term, update it here in the same change. For the decisions behind these
shapes, see `docs/adr/`.

## Platform and topology

- **Deployment**: one reachable Epicenter installation, hosted or self-hosted,
  with a canonical base URL and its own auth, storage, sync, and billing policy.
- **Connection**: the authenticated transport a client uses to reach one
  deployment. It carries credentials, cookies, or bearer behavior, but is not the
  data identity.
- **Principal**: the authenticated identity Epicenter uses as the partition key
  (ADR-0092). Cloud resolves many principals from Better Auth users; a
  self-hosted instance resolves every valid operator bearer to the literal
  `instance` principal. Durable namespaces use `principals/<principalId>/...`.
  Billing is hosted-only and lives in `apps/api/worker/billing/`.
- **Account**: one resolved principal inside one deployment. Credentials may
  rotate, but deployment identity plus `principalId` is the stable identity of
  the person's synchronized Epicenter.
- **Epicenter**: one person's logical body of rows, values, and row-owned
  documents. Applications bind typed Lenses to it; no workspace or database
  lifecycle exists beneath it.
- **Replica**: one complete local or server copy of an Epicenter. A native
  installation, browser origin, OS profile, or server actor may impose its own
  physical replica, but that adapter boundary is not a product data owner.
- **Epicenter store**: one runtime-private storage family backing a replica. Its
  physical relations and format version are implementation details, not an
  application SQL contract. Home may expose the stable logical inspection model
  through the store owner.
- **Sync attachment**: the permanent binding from a local replica to one
  principal. First sign-in adds synchronization to the existing replica;
  signing out pauses it, and another principal requires a fresh replica or
  explicit destructive clearing.
- **Epicenter Home**: the trusted shell above typed application surfaces. It owns
  navigation, assistant sessions, commands, approvals, and human and agent
  relational inspection; durable data such as conversations lives in ordinary
  tables and values.
- **Trusted app catalog**: the validated static SPAs Epicenter serves from one
  origin and grants one fixed app-window authority. Bundled output supplies the
  default catalog; user-built output may replace a member by app ID.
- **App composition repository**: an ordinary user-owned Git tree whose
  `apps/<id>` source members build the trusted app catalog. It is source, not
  Epicenter app data, runtime installation state, or a permission registry.
- **Account authority**: the one server replica for everything an authenticated
  principal stores. Its address derives from the principal alone. It orders
  whole-Epicenter scalar synchronization and hosts separate lazy row-document
  connections.
- **Row-document connection**: one authenticated Yjs 14 WebSocket for one
  currently open `(namespace key, table key, row ID)`. Its structured route address
  is lifecycle identity, not a secret; it is separate from the whole-Epicenter
  scalar exchange.
- **Row liveness**: the owner-local fact that a row address is currently
  live. Deletion replaces scalar state with a permanent compact tombstone and
  removes document bytes, so an offline replica cannot recreate that lifetime.
  Liveness is a lifecycle invariant, not a per-row ACL.
- **Star**: the one runnable program that holds your data, composing anchor,
  store, sync, and identity/auth into a deployment (ADR-0069). The star is the
  unit of self-host and the entire privacy question: Epicenter runs it (hosted)
  or you run it (self-host). Distinct from a **service you call** (inference,
  blob URLs): a service is addressed by `{baseUrl, token?}`, sees only the one
  payload you hand it, and is never part of the star's topology. "Single-user /
  sovereign" is a preset over the star's credential source and principal
  resolver, not a mode (ADR-0070, amended by ADR-0092).
- **Anchor**: the always-on node that holds synchronized state so a sleeping
  device can catch up. Who runs the anchor is the whole privacy question (ADR-0068):
  user-run gives topology privacy, Epicenter-run is trusted plaintext. Privacy moves
  by relocating the anchor, never by a setting in the app.
- **Relay**: moves bytes between a person's devices when they cannot reach each
  other directly, then forgets. Blind to content in principle. _Fused with the anchor
  today_: the hosted relay is one Cloudflare Durable Object that also holds and reads
  your plaintext (ADR-0035); separating the relay role from the anchor (ADR-0035) would
  let a blind relay route to an anchor you hold.
- **Store**: the anchor's app-blind sibling for big binaries (audio, images),
  `put` / `get` / `has` by reference; the doc carries the reference, never the bytes
  (ADR-0035). Any S3-compatible endpoint (versitygw for dev, Garage for self-host).
- **Trusted relay**: the server reads Epicenter plaintext. Zero-knowledge was
  evaluated and rejected; the encryption layer was removed (ADR-0004).
- **Node roles**: four distinct roles, separable even when one machine plays
  several (ADR-0049): _client_ runs the agent loop and binds the others;
  _inference server_ turns a prompt into tokens; _daemon_ holds data and runs
  dispatched tools but never infers; _relay/anchor_ is content-blind coordination
  and never infers.
- **Inference server**: the only node role that infers (ADR-0049). One stateless
  turn per request: given a prompt plus a tool catalog it streams tokens, returns
  the model's tool calls, and stops, leaving the client loop to execute them
  (ADR-0047). It sees the prompt and tools as accepted egress to the model
  (ADR-0033), so it is _not_ content-blind, unlike the relay, but it owns no loop,
  tool, or transcript. The wire is OpenAI-compatible (ADR-0050), so the box is
  swappable by base URL: Epicenter's metered gateway (house key, billed; it never
  accepts a provider key), a self-hosted gateway (your key or a local model), or
  any third-party OpenAI-compatible endpoint. A BYOK key is handed to a custom
  inference server (self-hosted or local), never to the Epicenter gateway or a
  daemon (ADR-0054).
- **Deployable vs library**: one library, `packages/server`, consumed by two
  deployables: `apps/api` (hosted personal cloud) and `apps/self-host` (the
  community single-partition instance reference, not Epicenter-operated; ADR-0075).
- **Cross-device planes**: cross-device work splits by responsibility. _Inference_ (the
  chat brain) streams tokens from an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (ADR-0050),
  over the inference seam. _Scalar sync_ carries rows and values through the
  Epicenter authority. _Document sync_ carries lazy Yjs history and row-scoped
  presence over row-document connections. _Invoke_ (the agent's hands) is local
  to the host that owns the tool process, unless a future product re-earns a
  direct URL-addressed box surface.
- **Infisical project**: the owner and access-control boundary. Each secret-using
  runnable surface owns its own `.infisical.json`: `apps/api` and `ops` point
  at Epicenter's hosted/operator project, and personal local apps use ignored
  app-local configs that point at the operator's personal project. The ignored
  configs are per-person bring-your-own provider setup; the committed configs
  are shared Epicenter infrastructure. A single-provider local app may instead
  cache its BYO client credentials to a machine-tier 0600 file after first
  connect (Local Mail's <data-dir>/provider.json), so it reads no per-worktree
  Infisical config on the run path; Infisical then only ever populates the
  environment for that first connect.
- **Infisical environment**: a value-stakes tier inside a project, not an
  owner. In the Epicenter project, `dev` holds substitute values that can hurt
  nothing (the local `wrangler dev` bindings) and `prod` holds hosted
  production/operator credentials. In a personal local-app project, `prod`
  holds the real provider credentials for the person running the tool. The path
  groups by app or surface (`/api`, `/ci`, `/ops`, `/apps/<app>`). The provider
  target rides in the qualified secret name (ADR-0108), never in the
  environment. The monorepo root has no Infisical config, so local apps cannot
  silently inherit Epicenter's hosted/operator project.

## Data API

- **Namespace key**: the durable reverse-domain coordinate at the front of a
  row or value address, such as `so.epicenter.whispering`. It structures
  addresses only and never creates a lifecycle, ownership, or sync scope.
- **Local data key**: the exact property name under a Lens's `tables` or
  `values`, such as `recordings` or `language`. Renaming it addresses different
  data; it is not an ergonomic alias.
- **Row address**: `(namespace key, table key, row ID)`, distinguished from a
  value address by its address kind. A row-owned document reuses this address.
- **Value address**: `(namespace key, value key)`, distinguished from a row
  address by its address kind.
- **Lens**: a pure JSON, partial, release-local interpretation of exactly one
  namespace. Lenses may overlap and are never authoritative schemas, owners, or
  lifecycle boundaries.
- **Table definition**: the pure JSON value under one Lens table property. It
  validates schema-opaque row fields but does not create storage, migrate, heal,
  rewrite, or grant access.
- **Value definition**: the pure JSON value under one Lens value property for
  one typed singleton with `get`, `set`, and `unset`.
- **Bound lens**: the synchronous borrowed typed view returned when a Lens binds
  to an open Epicenter. It creates no storage and owns no disposal.
- **Row**: one identified application value in a table. It is the public
  lifecycle aggregate. Its globally unique runtime-minted ID is never reused.
  Deletion installs a compact tombstone and removes document state.
- **Row tombstone**: terminal scalar state proving that a structured row address
  was deleted. It carries no application payload and remains so an indefinitely
  offline or restored replica cannot recreate that row lifetime. Value unset is
  nonterminal latest state and may be replaced by a later set.
- **Field key**: the exact permanent JSON key named by a table definition. There
  is no fallback key, alias, automatic rename, or storage default.
- **Field**: one `field.*` schema for a present JSON value. Table fields are
  required by default; a table's `optional` key array names fields that may be
  absent. Missing and `null` remain distinct.
- **Row-owned document**: the latent collaborative document owned by a row.
  It has no public id, authority, or lifecycle independent from the row. Its
  runtime-native provider persists and synchronizes it independently from
  scalar row sync.
- **Record**: not a platform lifecycle noun in the canonical data model.
  Use row for the durable application aggregate, fields for JSON values, and
  document for the row-owned CRDT state. Historical docs and transitional code
  may still use record while they migrate.
- **Conforming row**: a canonical row that satisfies the opened release's table
  definition. Reads return typed rows while reporting nonconforming stored data
  without hiding or silently repairing canonical state.
- **Optional field unset**: patching an optional field with `undefined` removes
  that key. Canonical JSON never stores `undefined`; `null` remains an ordinary
  value when its field accepts null.
- **Table list**: one bounded local typed application read with optional
  equality filters, one ordering key, cursor, and limit. Applications receive
  no SQL; Epicenter Home separately owns relational inspection.
- **Row document handle**: the revocable handle returned by a lazy row document
  open. It exposes application roots, local provider durability, and document
  connection status. Releasing the final handle may unload live Yjs state but
  never deletes persisted or synchronized content.
- **Scalar exchange**: the one whole-Epicenter HTTP operation that submits
  bounded pending local changes and pages authority latest state. Push, pull,
  and acquisition are not separate product or network operations.
- **Blob**: immutable bytes addressed by an opaque `BlobId` outside Epicenter
  scalar state. Rows and values may reference blobs; row-owned documents are
  bounded interactive CRDT state, not a media or large-file plane.
- **Data runtime**: one Epicenter replica composes typed table/value lenses and
  lazy Yjs 14 row documents over one private store.
- **Transitional root-Yjs workspace**: the still-active `@epicenter/workspace`
  lane used by apps not yet migrated. Its `defineKv`, definition-owned
  `create/connect/mount`, `.docs`, and `_v` behavior remain compatibility
  surfaces for those apps, not the canonical SQLite design.
- **Transitional `satisfiesWorkspace`**: the root-Yjs bundle-conformance helper
  (renamed from the older `defineWorkspaceBundle`).
- **Transitional actions and collaboration**: actions remain part of the
  root-Yjs workspace bundle; collaboration is sync and presence only.
- **Transitional root-Yjs child document**: a separate, lazy Y.Doc owned by one
  row and reached through `ws.tables.X.docs.name.open(rowId)`. The workspace
  derives its address from the workspace, table, a collision-resistant digest
  of the full row ID, document name, and document format hash; the format
  capability attaches the typed content handle after the runtime opens the doc.
- **Worker**: running behavior that observes workspace state and writes results
  back. Workers may be local (every node runs them) or agent-bound (one
  configured agent answers). A conversation is answered by the client agent loop
  in the open tab, for every agent (ADR-0047); the daemon contributes data and
  side effects as dispatched actions (tools), never by running the loop.
- **Agent**: the durable address a row or conversation binds to (an immutable
  id). An agent names who should answer; the peer that answers as it is the
  client tab or a daemon, set by the agent's **trust location** (ADR-0030/0043).
- **Trust location**: where an agent's data and tools live, and therefore where
  its side effects run (ADR-0030, ADR-0047). The reasoning loop always runs in
  the client, which drives an inference server (ADR-0049); what varies is the
  agent's capability. A **capability-free** agent (Vocab) has no tools. A
  **local-data** agent (Local Books) keeps its data and action handlers on the
  user's own always-on daemon, which the client loop reaches by dispatching
  actions; data leaves the daemon only as a tool result. The relay is
  content-blind; the inference server is a stateless turn that sees the prompt as
  accepted egress (not content-blind). Trust is per-agent, not global.
- **Conversation loop**: the client-side loop that answers every conversation,
  streams the live turn into a snapshot the UI renders, and persists finished
  messages as records (ADR-0047). It replaces the older doc-observing _answerer_
  (a daemon that wrote the reply into the doc), which ADR-0047 removed. Two
  implementations exist, chosen by transcript reach (ADR-0048): a transcript that
  syncs across a person's peers uses the workspace loop (`createConversation`,
  finished messages in a Yjs child doc); a deliberately device-local transcript
  uses TanStack `createChat` (tab-manager, IndexedDB).
- **Materializer**: a local, addressless worker that projects workspace data into
  another store (markdown, sqlite).
- **`attach*` vs `create*`**: `attach*` are side-effectful primitives that register
  listeners at call time; `create*` are pure construction.

## Transitional root-Yjs app composition

- **`create<App>`**: the isomorphic doc factory for an app.
- **`open<App>Browser` / `open<App>Extension` / tauri**: environment factories.
- **`#platform/*`**: the build-time platform DI seam for multi-platform (Tauri) apps.
- **`session`**: the singleton holding the signed-in workspace lifecycle.
- **deviceConfig vs workspace KV**: per-device settings (global shortcuts, machine
  collisions) versus synced settings (local shortcuts). The asymmetry is deliberate.
- **Vault**: the designated, not-yet-built home for the one encryption that
  survives ADR-0004: an explicitly encrypted, shared workspace for secrets only
  (blind relay, Argon2-derived key). Its primitives were removed with the
  encryption layer; it returns minimally if a secrets path is built. Distinct
  from the Matter vault (a folder of Markdown).

## CLI and watcher

- **Epicenter root**: a directory whose `epicenter.config.ts` declares one mount.
  Discovery walks up to the nearest one. One root, one watcher.
- **Watcher**: the long-lived foreground process started by `epicenter up`.
  It opens the root's mount, owns the lease, joins sync when signed in, and keeps
  materializers alive. It is not a callable action server. Internal code still
  uses `daemon` names (`DaemonMetadata`, `claimDaemonLease`) for this process.
- **Peer**: a device currently present in the same row-document subscription.
  Presence is server-owned and carried by that document's connection, then
  surfaced by app UI or watcher logs, not a generic CLI query.
- **Watcher lifecycle commands**: `up`, `down`, `status`, and `logs`. They use
  metadata, pid liveness, logs, and OS signals. No Unix socket or daemon action
  client exists.
- **Library script**: a `bun ./script.ts` that reads materialized SQLite or
  Markdown directly. Generic off-process writes are deliberately absent; real
  write workflows should earn an app-specific command or in-process script.
