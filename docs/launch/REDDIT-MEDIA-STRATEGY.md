# Reddit Media Strategy for Each Subreddit

## FINAL DECISIONS:

## Technical Subreddits (Use Screenshots/Code)

### r/sveltejs - **Screenshot of Code**
- Show beautiful Svelte 5 runes code
- Technical audience wants to see implementation
- Video might be too "salesy"

### r/tauri - **Architecture Diagram or App Screenshot**
- Show the lightweight app running
- Focus on technical achievement
- They care about bundle size and performance

### r/rust - **Performance Metrics Screenshot**
- Show memory usage, bundle size comparison
- Technical data visualization
- They want proof of Rust benefits

### r/OpenAI - **Link Post to GitHub**
- They're familiar with API usage
- Direct to documentation is best
- Show code examples in post

## General/Productivity Subreddits (Use Video)

### r/productivity - **3-min Voice Coding Video**
- Show the workflow transformation
- Visual demonstration of speed
- They want to see productivity gains

### r/Anthropic - **3-min Voice Coding Video**
- Shows Claude Code integration
- Demonstrates the AI workflow
- Perfect for their audience

## Privacy/FOSS Subreddits (Use Screenshots)

### r/selfhosted - **Screenshot of Settings**
- Show API key configuration
- Emphasize local control
- They care about data ownership

### r/opensource - **Link to GitHub**
- Direct to source code
- They want to inspect the code
- Screenshot of GitHub stars/activity

### r/accessibility - **Screenshot or GIF**
- Show voice activation in action
- Focus on hands-free operation
- Avoid video with audio (ironic for accessibility)

## Decision Framework:
1. **Technical subs**: Code/architecture screenshots
2. **Workflow subs**: Video demonstrations
3. **Privacy subs**: Settings/control screenshots
4. **FOSS subs**: Direct GitHub links

## Why This Strategy:
- Technical audiences are skeptical of videos (too promotional)
- Productivity audiences need visual proof
- Privacy audiences want to see control/ownership
- Each subreddit has different cultural expectations
