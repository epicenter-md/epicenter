## Next Steps
Please continue with the launch campaign by:

1. Check the LAUNCH-PLAN.md for the next platform to post on
2. Review the corresponding platform post in `/docs/launch/platform-posts/`
3. Help me prepare and post to that platform
4. After posting, update the file with:
   - Status: ✅ POSTED
   - Posted URL: [the actual URL]
5. Update this continuation prompt with the new completed task

## Important Guidelines
- Always ask for the posted URL after completing a post
- Update the platform post file with the status and URL
- Keep track of all posted URLs for the final summary
- Follow the specific guidelines for each platform (character limits, hashtags, etc.)

## Platform-Specific Notes
- Reddit: Use "Show r/[subreddit]:" format for titles
- Twitter/X: Keep under character limit, use relevant hashtags
- LinkedIn: Professional tone, emphasize business value
- Discord: Casual, developer-focused, emphasize community

Please continue with the next platform in the launch plan!
