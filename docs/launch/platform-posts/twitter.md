# Twitter/X Launch Strategy

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Native Video Upload Strategy

**BEFORE POSTING:**
1. Download the 3-minute demo from YouTube
2. Upload directly to Twitter (NOT as a link)
3. NO LINKS in first tweet (algorithm penalty)
4. First 30 minutes determine success - be ready to engage

## Primary Launch Thread (10:30 AM PST)

### Tweet 1 (Hook + Native Video)
I code hands-free while managing 6 AI agents in parallel.

Here's how I talk to my computer to build software faster:

[NATIVE VIDEO UPLOAD - 3 minute demo]

### Tweet 2 (The Reveal + GitHub Link)
It's called Whispering: a completely free, open-source transcription tool I built.

While others charge $30/month, you just bring your own API key and pay cents directly to providers.

GitHub: https://github.com/braden-w/whispering#readme

### Tweet 3 (The Philosophy)
I built this for myself and made it open-source from day one.

When I discovered competitors charge $30/month for what's basically an API wrapper, I was glad I chose a different path.

### Tweet 4 (Technical Details + Setup Guide)
Built with:
- @sveltejs 5 (production runes)
- @tauri_apps (lightweight native app)
- @tan_stack Query (reactive state)
- TypeScript + Rust

No servers. No tracking. Just your voice â†’ your code.

### Tweet 5 (Call to Action + More Tech)
Try the voice coding workflow yourself:

Installation: https://github.com/braden-w/whispering#installation

And thank you to the amazing open-source community that made this possible!

## First 30 Minutes Engagement Plan

**CRITICAL ACTIONS:**
1. Reply to EVERY comment immediately
2. Like comments quickly
3. Quote tweet yourself with additional context if taking off
4. Have friends/team ready to engage early

**Prepared Responses:**
- "How do I set this up?" â†’ Here's a 5-min guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jYgBMrfVZs
- "What's the catch?" â†’ No catch. I built this for myself and use it daily. The code is open source so you can verify everything yourself.
- "How is this different?" â†’ You own everything. Your API keys, your data, your costs. No middleman.
- Technical questions â†’ The implementation details are all on GitHub!

## Alternative: Pure Tool Thread (If Video Doesn't Perform by Noon)

### Tweet 1 (Problem/Solution Hook)
Transcription apps charging $30/month for API wrappers is insane.

So I built a free, open-source alternative where you bring your own API key.

A thread on why transcription should be free ðŸ§µ

### Tweet 2 (The Math + Link)
The math:
- Competitors: $30/month
- Actual API cost: $0.02-0.18/hour
- Your savings: 99%+

Whispering is 100% free and open source.

GitHub: https://github.com/braden-w/whispering

### Tweet 3 (How It Works)
How it works:
1. Download Whispering (Mac/Windows/Linux)
2. Add your API key (OpenAI, Groq, etc)
3. Start transcribing

Your audio â†’ Your chosen API â†’ You
No middleman. No markup. No BS.

### Tweet 4 (The Story)
I've been using this daily for 6 months (3-4 hours/day).

My total cost? About $3/month going directly to Groq.

If I used a competitor? $30/month for the exact same API calls.

### Tweet 5 (The Philosophy)
I believe essential tools should be:
- Free to use
- Open to inspect
- Yours to control

No subscriptions. No limits. No data collection.
Just transcription as it should be.

## Why This Strategy Works

### Native Video Advantages
- **2-3x more reach** than YouTube links
- **Auto-plays in timeline** (YouTube links don't)
- **No friction** - users stay on platform
- **Better analytics** - full Twitter metrics
- **Mobile optimized** - 70% of users on mobile

### Your Hook is Perfect Because
- Creates curiosity (managing 6 AI agents)
- Shows unique workflow (hands-free coding)
- Personal story (not corporate)
- Specific capability (parallel multitasking)
- Visual payoff in video

### Viral Triggers in Your Demo
- **Paradigm shift**: Voice replaces typing
- **Cost shock**: $0.02/hr vs $30/month
- **Live demo**: Seeing voice â†’ code is magical
- **Relatable**: Everyone knows typing fatigue
- **David vs Goliath**: Open source vs paid apps

## If Video Takes Off (2 PM Quote Tweet)

"A lot of people asking about the setup.

It takes 5 minutes:
1. Download Whispering
2. Get a Groq API key (free)
3. Paste it in settings

That's it. You're now transcribing at $0.02/hour instead of paying $30/month.

## Follow-up Tweets (Next 24-48 Hours)

### If Video Goes Viral:
"Update: 10K developers tried the voice coding workflow in 24 hours.

Most common reaction: 'Why was I typing all this time?'

If you missed it: [link to original thread]"

### Testimonial Amplification:
"Someone just DM'd me: 'I canceled my $30/month subscription and saved $300/year'

This is why I open sourced Whispering.

Transcription should be free."

### Technical Deep Dive:
"For the devs asking about the Svelte 5 implementation:
