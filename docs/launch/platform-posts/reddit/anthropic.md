I manage 6 Claude Code agents in parallel by talking to my computer - here's the workflow

## Post Content

Hey r/Anthropic!

I wanted to share a workflow that's completely changed how I use Claude Code. I can now manage 6 different Claude agents in parallel just by talking.

Here's what I do: I speak my thoughts naturally while coding, Whispering transcribes it instantly, and I paste that into Claude Code. Claude just gets it. No more carefully crafting prompts - I just talk like I'm explaining to a colleague.

The speed difference is insane. Speaking is 3x faster than typing, but more importantly, I stay in flow state. When I'm deep in a problem, I can just ramble about what I'm trying to solve and Claude picks up on all the context.

I built Whispering specifically for this workflow. It's free and open source - you bring your own API key (OpenAI, Groq, whatever) and your audio goes directly to them. No middleman servers. Costs me about $0.02/hour instead of the $30/month other apps charge.

The video shows me actually coding this way - managing multiple Claude agents, describing complex refactors, debugging by thinking out loud. It's like pair programming but Claude never gets tired of my rambling.

Built with Svelte 5 and Tauri so it's tiny and starts instantly. Works on Mac, Windows, Linux.

Anyone else using voice with Claude? What's your workflow?
