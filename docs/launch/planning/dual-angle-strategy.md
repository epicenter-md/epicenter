# Dual-Angle Launch Strategy

## Two Distinct Narratives

### Angle 1: Traditional Open Source Launch
"Free, open-source transcription app as an alternative to paid services"
- Focus: Philosophy, cost savings, privacy
- Best for: HN, r/opensource, r/selfhosted

### Angle 2: Productivity Workflow Revolution
"Voice-driven development with Whispering + Claude Code"
- Focus: Hands-free coding, 2¢/hour cost with Groq, productivity benefits
- Best for: Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, YC Vibe Coders

## Platform-Specific Strategy

### Hacker News (7:00 AM PST)
**Primary Post**: Traditional angle
- "Show HN: Whispering - Free, open-source transcription app built with Svelte 5 + Tauri"
- Focus on technical implementation, philosophy
- Mention workflow in comments if asked

**Follow-up (Day 2-3)**: Workflow angle
- "Show HN: How I code 3x faster with voice using Whispering + Claude Code"
- Include metrics, cost breakdown
- Link back to original post

### Reddit Strategy

**Technical Subreddits** (r/sveltejs, r/rust, r/opensource):
- Lead with traditional angle
- Technical implementation details
- Open source philosophy

**Productivity Subreddits** (r/productivity, r/getdisciplined):
- Lead with workflow angle
- "I code 3x faster and it costs me 2¢/hour"
- Include video demonstration

**r/Anthropic & r/LocalLLaMA**:
- Pure workflow angle
- "The perfect companion to Claude Code"
- Show the voice → code pipeline

### YC Communities

**YC Bookface** (11:00 AM PST):
- Business angle: "Built this to scratch my own itch, saved $300/year"
- Mention daily usage, potential market

**Vibe Coders Chat**:
- Pure workflow post
- "Voice coding setup that actually works"
- Share the full demo video

**Batch Engineering Slack**:
- Technical + workflow hybrid
- "Svelte 5 + Tauri app for voice coding"

### Visual Platforms Strategy

**Twitter/X** (9:00 AM PST):
- Start with workflow GIF
- "I stopped typing code. Here's my 2¢/hour voice setup"
- Thread explains Whispering + traditional angle

**TikTok/Instagram Reels**:
- Pure workflow content
- "POV: You discover voice coding"
- Quick cuts of voice → code → running app
- Viral potential: "Why are you still typing code in 2025?"

**LinkedIn** (3:00 PM PST):
- Professional productivity angle
- Both narratives combined
- "Open source tool + modern workflow = 3x productivity"

## Timing Strategy

### Day 1: Establish Presence
- Morning: Traditional angle on HN
- Midday: Mix of both angles on Reddit
- Afternoon: Workflow angle on visual platforms

### Day 2-3: Capitalize on Momentum
- Return to successful platforms with opposite angle
- "You liked Whispering? Here's how I actually use it"
- Cross-pollinate audiences

### Day 4-7: Sustained Push
- Share workflow tutorials
- Respond to "how do I set this up?" questions
- Build community around both use cases

## Key Insights

1. **Don't mix angles in primary posts** - Pick one narrative per post
2. **Use comments/threads** to introduce the other angle
3. **Visual platforms** = workflow angle wins
4. **Technical platforms** = traditional angle first, workflow as bonus
5. **Business platforms** = combine both (cost + productivity)

## Viral Video Strategy

**The Hook**: "I haven't typed code in 3 months"
**The Story**: Show the setup, the speed, the cost
**The Twist**: "And the tool is completely free"
**CTA**: "Link in bio for the GitHub"

## Platform Expertise Notes

### Hacker News Expertise
- Never self-promote aggressively
- Let the tool speak for itself
- Be ready for skepticism about "voice coding"
- Have benchmarks ready (WPM equivalent, error rates)
- Emphasize the technical challenge solved

### Reddit Expertise
- Each sub has different tolerance for self-promotion
- r/rust wants Tauri implementation details
- r/productivity wants time saved metrics
- r/Anthropic wants Claude Code integration specifics
- Always provide value beyond just announcing

### YC Communities Expertise
- Bookface: Business metrics matter (users, growth potential)
- Vibe Coders: They want the "aha" moment
- Engineering Slack: Technical depth + practical application
