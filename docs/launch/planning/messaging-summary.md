# Whispering Launch Messaging Summary

## Core Value Proposition
**"Transcription should be free, open, and private"**

## Key Messages

### 1. Price Comparison
- Paid services: $15-30/month
- Whispering with Groq: ~$0.02/hour
- Whispering with OpenAI: ~$0.10-0.18/hour
- **Whispering app: Free forever (you pay providers directly)**

### 2. Unique Differentiators
- Bring your own API key (pay cents, not dollars)
- 100% open source (audit the code yourself)
- Direct API calls (no middleman servers)
- No limits, no premium tiers (competitors have limited free tiers)
- Cross-platform support
- Truly unlimited (vs competitors' 15min/day, 2,000 words/week limits)

### 3. Philosophy/Mission
- Essential productivity tools should be accessible to everyone
- Transcription is a fundamental right, not a premium service
