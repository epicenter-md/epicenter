Whispering v7.0.0 represents the **biggest rewrite** in the project's entire history. We completely rewrote the application's [query layer](https://github.com/braden-w/whispering/blob/main/apps/app/src/lib/query/README.md), [service architecture](https://github.com/braden-w/whispering/blob/main/apps/app/src/lib/services/README.md), and UI foundations.

**Impact by the Numbers:**
- `507` files changed
- `26,422` lines added, `35,536` lines removed
- Net reduction of `9,114` lines through better code organization

This is a comprehensive architectural overhaul that enhances everything. The UI responds more quickly to your actions. Errors are clearer and recover automatically. The new **visual shortcut recorder** displays your key combinations in real-time. And with support for local transcription through `Speaches`, you can now use Whispering **completely offline** without any API keys.

But honestly, what you'll notice most is just how much smoother everything feels. The app responds the way you'd expect it to, without the weird delays or quirks from v6.
