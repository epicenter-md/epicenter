Whispering v7.0.0 represents the **biggest rewrite** in the project's entire history. We've completely rebuilt the application from the ground up, touching nearly every line of code to deliver a **faster**, **more reliable**, and **more maintainable** experience.

This is a comprehensive architectural overhaul that enhances everything. The UI responds more quickly to your actions. Errors are clearer and recover automatically. The new **visual shortcut recorder** displays your key combinations in real-time. And with support for local transcription through `Speaches`, you can now use Whispering **completely offline** without any API keys.

The numbers tell the story: **`507`** files were changed, resulting in a net reduction of almost **`10,000`** lines of code through improved organization.

But honestly, what you'll notice most is just how much smoother everything feels. The app responds the way you'd expect it to, without the weird delays or quirks from v6.
