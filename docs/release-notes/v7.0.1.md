## v7.0.1 - Fix Linux Window Closing Issue

This patch release removes the problematic "Close to Tray" feature that was preventing the application from closing properly on Linux systems.

**Changes:**
- Removed close-to-tray functionality entirely
- App now closes normally when the close button is clicked
- Fixes issue #550 where Linux users couldn't close the app

The feature was causing the window close event to be intercepted and hidden instead of allowing the app to quit. This particularly affected Linux users who had no way to properly exit the application without using system monitor or terminal commands.

We decided to remove this feature entirely rather than fix it because:
1. It was causing significant usability issues on Linux
2. The implementation was platform-inconsistent
3. Users expect standard close button behavior
