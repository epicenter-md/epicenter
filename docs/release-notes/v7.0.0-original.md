## üèóÔ∏è **Complete Architecture Rewrite**

Whispering v7.0.0 introduces a new three-layer architecture that enables extensive code sharing between desktop and web versions while improving performance and maintainability.

**TanStack Query Integration**: We now use TanStack Query (with a custom Svelte 5 fork) for data management, providing intelligent caching, optimistic UI updates, and consistent error handling.

**Pure Service Layer**: Business logic is now completely separated from UI concerns. Platform differences (desktop vs web) are handled automatically, allowing the same code to work seamlessly across all platforms.

**Unified Operations**: All app operations are available through a single `rpc.*` interface that provides both reactive patterns for UI components and direct execution for actions.

### What This Means for You

- **Instant UI updates**: Changes appear immediately, even before server confirmation
- **Smarter caching**: Data loads instantly when revisiting screens  
- **Better error messages**: Clear, actionable errors instead of cryptic failures
- **Consistent experience**: Desktop and web versions work identically
- **Improved performance**: Operations run faster with less memory overhead
