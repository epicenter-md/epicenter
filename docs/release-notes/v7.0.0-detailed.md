## Key User Improvements

### Performance & Reliability
- Instant UI updates with optimistic caching
- Smart data caching - screens load instantly on revisit
- Automatic retry logic for network failures
- 30% memory reduction
- Faster startup time

### New Features
- **Visual shortcut recorder** - See key combinations in real-time
- **Local transcription** - Speaches provider for complete privacy
- **Auto-updates** - One-click updates when available
- **Mobile support** - Fully responsive design
- **Device hot-swapping** - Plug in a new mic and it works

### Better Error Handling
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Automatic recovery from transient failures
- Detailed error context for debugging

## Architecture Changes

### Three-Layer Architecture

We've adopted a clean three-layer architecture that enables extensive code sharing between desktop and web:

```
UI Layer (Svelte 5) â†’ Query Layer (TanStack) â†’ Service Layer (Pure Functions)
```

- **Service Layer**: Platform-agnostic business logic with Result types
- **Query Layer**: Adds reactivity and caching on top of services
- **UI Layer**: Thin components that use the unified `rpc.*` interface

### Key Technical Improvements
- TanStack Query integration (custom Svelte 5 fork)
- WellCrafted Result types for error handling
- Pure static builds (no SSR)
- Unified RPC pattern for all operations
- Build-time platform detection

---

## Breaking Changes

- Settings format changed (automatic migration provided)
- Some keyboard shortcuts may need reconfiguration
- Browser extension temporarily disabled

---

## Bug Fixes

### Critical Fixes
- Fixed global shortcuts not registering on app restart
- Fixed recording device errors with automatic fallback
- Fixed macOS Option key producing dead keys in shortcuts
- Fixed dialog layering issues

### Platform-Specific
- Fixed Windows notification permissions
- Fixed Linux AppImage auto-update
- Fixed macOS accessibility prompts
- Fixed clipboard access on web
