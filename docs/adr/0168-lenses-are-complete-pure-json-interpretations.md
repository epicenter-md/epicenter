# 0168. Lenses are complete pure JSON interpretations

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-07-20
- **Amends:** [ADR-0120](0120-fields-validate-present-values-and-table-lenses-own-presence.md), [ADR-0125](0125-record-definitions-are-release-local-lenses-and-never-migrate-user-data.md), and [ADR-0160](0160-lenses-interpret-durable-namespaces-without-creating-lifecycle-scopes.md)

## Context

Epicenter Home must load a Lens without executing application source code. The
same Lens should be authorable with TypeScript inference, durable as an ordinary
JSON file, inspectable by people and agents, and validatable after download.
TypeBox builder objects and compiled validators are convenient runtime tools,
but functions, symbols, prototypes, and caches cannot be part of that durable
contract.

## Decision

A Lens and every nested table, value, field schema, and metadata value are pure
JSON data. `JSON.stringify` followed by `JSON.parse` preserves the complete Lens
semantics. No custom serialization step, source module, function, compiled
validator, or hidden side table is required to recover it.

`defineLens`, `defineTable`, and `defineValue` are TypeScript authoring helpers.
They preserve literal keys and derive ergonomic static types, but return the
same canonical JSON shape accepted from disk. TypeBox field builders are
canonicalized into their JSON Schema representation at this boundary.

Member names in the Lens's definition maps carry durable identity. In this
definition:

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "transcript": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "Transcript"
    }
  }
}
```

`transcript` is the exact permanent field key, while the nested object is only
the present-value schema and its semantic annotations. `field.string()` alone
does not define an identified field; the containing `fields` entry does. It
does not repeat that key in an `id` or `key` property. This does not require
every stored row to contain `transcript`: the table's `optional` list decides
whether that key may be absent when the Lens interprets a row. The
runtime-owned row ID is separate structural identity and cannot appear in
`fields`.

This follows one identity rule across the model: the containing owner supplies
identity. The Lens supplies its namespace, the `tables` and `values` objects
supply their durable local keys, the `fields` object supplies field keys, and
the runtime supplies row IDs. A Lens contains no name mapping at any level. The
outer object passed to a multi-Lens bind may use ergonomic aliases only because
those member names identify no durable data.

`parseLens(unknown)` is the single legitimacy law for arbitrary Lens JSON. It:

1. validates the closed outer Lens, table, and value structures;
2. recognizes every nested field schema as supported Epicenter field
   vocabulary; and
3. checks semantic relationships that JSON Schema alone cannot express.

Those semantic checks include namespace and local-key grammar, unknown or
duplicate optional field names, and any future cross-field constraints. Invalid
installed Lenses remain visible as broken artifacts with a concrete parse error.
The closed field vocabulary rejects a nested `id` or `key`; Home does not
silently discard either property.

Every Lens requires `namespace`, `title`, and `description`. Every table and
value requires `title`; their descriptions and field-level title and description
annotations are optional semantic metadata. Presentation policy such as icons,
column width, default sorting, or a `preview` field list is not part of a Lens.

Table fields are required by default. A table carries one canonical
`optional: string[]` whose entries must be unique keys from its `fields` object.
The TypeScript helper constrains entries to `keyof fields`; `parseLens` enforces
the same rule at runtime. Missing and `null` remain distinct, so nullable field
schemas do not replace optionality.

Validators are ephemeral derived functions. Binding or reading a valid Lens may
compile them synchronously. The platform initially stores no compiled validator
and maintains no validator `WeakMap`. A transparent cache may be introduced
later only if it changes neither Lens validity nor observable semantics.

## Consequences

- Home can load, inspect, validate, and render a downloaded Lens without running
  an application's JavaScript.
- TypeScript and JSON have one semantic representation rather than parallel
  source and manifest formats.
- A field's name in application code, stored JSON, diagnostics, and Home
  inspection is always the same permanent key.
- Any valid parsed Lens can reconstruct all runtime validation behavior.
- Optionality is explicit, type-safe for authors, and directly checkable from
  untrusted JSON.
- UI preferences can evolve independently without making a data interpretation
  look different merely because it was installed on another device.
- Changing a field's application property name changes which stored key it
  addresses. A code-facing rename that must not touch storage is ordinary local
  projection in application code, not Lens configuration.

## Considered alternatives

- **Persist TypeBox builder objects as-is.** Rejected because builder runtime
  details are not the portable Lens contract even when their enumerable parts
  currently resemble JSON Schema.
- **Store source code and execute it to recover a Lens.** Rejected because Home
  must inspect untrusted installed artifacts without granting code execution.
- **Give every field a required nested `id` and treat its object key as an
  ergonomic alias.** A required ID would map deterministically to one storage
  key, and `parseLens` could reject duplicates. It is rejected because durable
  keys are the interoperation vocabulary: raw inspection, diagnostics, agents,
  references, and other Lenses over the same table must still speak the stored
  key. A per-Lens alias therefore disappears exactly where sharing happens and
  buys only a private code-facing rename that application-local projection
  already provides. It would also make fields the only address coordinate with
  two names and would either wrap every field schema or put identity metadata
  inside a schema that describes stored values only ([ADR-0169](0169-row-references-are-non-enforcing-table-interpretations.md)).
  This design refuses that rename promise: change `title` for display, project
  locally for code ergonomics, or use a new field key with explicit writes when
  stored data must move.
- **Use nullable schemas instead of optional fields.** Rejected because `null`
  is a value while absence is a row-shape fact.
- **Persist or require compiled validators.** Rejected because they are derived
  executable state and would make JSON insufficient.
- **Include display layout and preview metadata.** Rejected because a Lens owns
  semantic interpretation, not one viewer's presentation policy.
