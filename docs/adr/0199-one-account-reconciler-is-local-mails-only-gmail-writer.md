# 0199. One reconciler per account is Local Mail's only Gmail writer

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-01
- **Amends:** [ADR-0082](0082-local-mail-syncs-by-push-free-history-list-polling.md) at its write-through clause and [ADR-0116](0116-local-mail-is-desktop-first-one-bun-engine-no-background-mail-service.md) at its "triage writes are Gmail-first" invariant. A triage write no longer travels from the request path to Gmail. Both records' other decisions, including push-free polling, the single sync owner, lock-free reads, and the no-background-service refusal, are untouched and this record depends on them.
- **Relates:** [ADR-0198](0198-a-durable-local-mail-write-is-a-per-message-label-assertion-in-a-sibling-intent-database.md) (the assertions this drains), [ADR-0098](0098-local-mail-state-round-trips-through-gmail.md) (Gmail holds every state a human acts on, which is what delivery is for), [ADR-0196](0196-local-mails-mirror-is-a-reader-and-one-full-message-fetch-is-its-entire-budget.md) (the per-message read budget the pull phase spends), [ADR-0188](0188-gmail-app-identity-belongs-to-the-distribution-and-no-epicenter-server-enters-the-gmail-path.md) (the Gmail identity whose per-user quota every call below is charged against)

## Context

ADR-0198 gives an undelivered write a durable home. It does not say who sends it,
and today the answer is "whoever handled the request": `modify.ts` is called
directly by the CLI verbs, the MCP tool, and the HTTP route, each on its own
process and its own schedule. Meanwhile the sync loop is separately serialized by
a per-account lock so that two bulk pulls cannot race one `historyId` cursor
(ADR-0116). So Gmail writes and Gmail reads for one account are governed by two
different disciplines, and a write can land between a pull's page 1 and page 2.

With durable intent that arrangement stops being merely untidy. If two surfaces
can each drain the same assertion, the same label change is sent twice and the
retirement of one can erase the other's newer opinion. If a pull runs before a
drain, the pull re-folds the pre-write labels and the user watches their archive
come back for one poll interval.

## Decision

**For each account there is exactly one reconciler, and it is the only thing in
Local Mail that writes to Gmail. It runs one pass at a time: drain the account's
assertions, retire each one that Gmail confirms, then pull Gmail's facts.**

Nothing else calls `messages.modify`, `messages.trash`, or `messages.untrash`.
The CLI verbs, the MCP tools, and the HTTP routes all assert and return.

### Why this replaces write-through rather than refining it

Write-through (ADR-0082, ADR-0116) made the request path the writer: the click
called Gmail, and the mirror folded the response. It failed on three counts, and
none of them is fixable by retrying harder.

1. **It had nowhere to put a write it could not send.** Offline or throttled, the
   act was simply lost, and the browser projection that hid this fact lived in
   memory and died on reload.
2. **It had as many writers as it had surfaces.** The CLI, MCP, and HTTP each
   called Gmail independently, so two of them could send conflicting changes for
   one message, and either could land between two pages of a pull.
3. **It made the durable effect synchronous with the click**, which is the one
   property that cannot survive an offline-capable client. Everything else
   write-through promised, Gmail as authority and the mirror written only from
   Gmail's response, is preserved here exactly.

The correction is therefore not "write-through plus a retry queue". It is moving
the write's durable moment from the network call to a local assertion, and giving
the network call one owner.

### The pass, in order

1. **Drain.** Read every assertion for this account. Group by `message_id`, and
   deliver each message's opinions.
2. **Retire on confirmation.** A Gmail response that carries the message's
   current `labelIds` is the acceptance proof. Delete the exact rows it proves,
   identified by `(message_id, label_id, seq)`, and fold the returned labels into
   the mirror.
3. **Pull.** Run the existing sync pass (`history.list`, or a full pull when the
   cursor is stale) against the same mirror.

Drain before pull is load-bearing and not an optimization. It means the pull that
follows observes the mailbox the user just asked for, so a confirmed write is
never briefly un-done by a history record written before it.

A failed drain does not skip the pull. Reading stays available when writing is
not: a rejected token or an offline machine leaves assertions in place and the
pull fails on its own terms, which is the behaviour ADR-0116 already promises for
reads.

### How one message's opinions are delivered

Split the message's rows into wanted and unwanted label ids and send one
`users.messages.modify` with `addLabelIds` and `removeLabelIds`. Gmail returns
the modified `Message`, which is the per-id acceptance proof retirement needs
(verified against Google's `users.messages.modify` reference, 2026-08-01; the
same reference caps a single request at 100 label ids in each direction, which is
far above anything a triage act produces).

`TRASH` is delivered by `users.messages.trash` and `users.messages.untrash`,
which are Gmail's own verbs for it and which also return the modified `Message`.
This is the only place trash is special. It is stored as an ordinary label
assertion (ADR-0198), it is asserted through the same call as every other label,
and it is projected into read models as an ordinary label. A message carrying
both a trash assertion and label assertions gets the label modify first and the
trash call second, each retiring only its own rows, so an "archive and trash"
lands as both rather than as a race.

Per-message cost, from Google's published quota table (verified 2026-08-01):
`messages.modify` is 5 units, `messages.trash` is 20, `messages.untrash` is 5,
against a ceiling of 6,000 units per user per minute. Delivery is cheap next to
the pull it precedes, where `messages.get` alone is 20 units per message
(ADR-0196).

### What retirement may delete, and nothing more

Retirement deletes the row whose `(message_id, label_id, seq)` matches what the
delivery actually carried. If the user re-asserted that pair while the call was
in flight, `seq` has moved, the delete matches nothing, and the newer opinion
survives to be delivered on the next pass.

This is the whole of the newer-write protection, and it is why ADR-0198 allocates
a sequence on every assertion rather than only on the first. Retiring by key
alone would silently discard the user's most recent decision whenever it raced a
delivery, which is precisely the case a user creates by pressing undo quickly.

A pair re-asserted to the same value mid-flight is redelivered once. The extra
call is a no-op at Gmail and costs 5 units; comparing `want` as well as `seq`
would avoid it and is deliberately not done, because the simpler predicate is the
one a reviewer can confirm is correct.

### When an assertion cannot be achieved

**One refusal happens before the row exists, and it is about shape, not facts.**
An assertion's key is a Gmail label id, so a label the user names has to resolve
to an id at act time. Gmail's system ids resolve to themselves; a custom name
resolves against the mirror's `labels` table (ADR-0198). A name that does not
resolve cannot become a keyed assertion at all, and it is refused to the user's
face with nothing written. That is a well-formedness check on the key, and it is
the only pre-creation refusal this record establishes.

**It is not a check that the assertion will succeed, and no such check exists.**
Nothing consults the mirror to decide whether an assertion is achievable,
redundant, or already satisfied. The mirror lags Gmail by up to a poll interval
and may be mid-backfill, so a "the mirror already agrees" test would drop real
writes on stale evidence. Achievability is settled by Gmail at delivery and
nowhere else.

At delivery, a per-id `400` or `404` means Gmail will not accept a change for
that message, usually because it was deleted or purged, and retrying cannot fix
it. **The assertion is discarded and the discard is reported in that pass's
result**, then the drain continues to the next message. There is no failure row,
no unachievable state, and nothing to clean up later, because a row that cannot
ever be delivered has no reason to outlive the pass that learned so. This is a
provider verdict, which is the only kind of evidence allowed to end an
assertion's life other than success or an explicit human discard.

Everything else, a rejected token, a throttle, a network error, is systemic. The
pass stops delivering, every affected row keeps its opinion **exactly as it was**,
and the next wake tries again. Nothing is written to the assertions: a systemic
failure is a fact about the pass, not about any row in it, and the reconciler
reports it as the pass's failure.

Retries are therefore unbounded and unpaced by anything stored. What bounds them
is a human: the count and age are visible, and discard is one action away. That
is the entire retry policy, and it is deliberately not a schedule.

### What wakes it

App start, the existing poll interval, a local write (coalesced, so a burst of
keyboard triage is one wake and not one per keystroke), and an explicit reconcile
the user or an agent asks for. Nothing else, and nothing after the app closes.

There is no background mail service and this record does not add one (ADR-0116).
An assertion made while nothing owns the reconciler simply waits, visibly, until
something does. The headless surfaces keep their promise: a one-shot `local-mail
reconcile` takes ownership for its single pass and drains, and a CLI triage verb
run while no app is open asserts and then drains in the same process. When the
open app already owns the account, a second process asserts and yields, and the
open app's next wake delivers it. That is a strictly better arrangement than
today, where the second process would have written to Gmail behind the first
one's back.

### Ownership

The per-account lock that ADR-0116 introduced for sync ownership becomes the
reconciler lock, covering drain and pull together. There is no second lock and no
second owner, so "who may write to Gmail for this account" and "who may advance
this account's cursor" are one question with one answer.

**Ownership is a capability the pass demands, not a convention its callers
follow.** Running a pass requires the lock as a value: acquiring it is the only
way to obtain one, it names the account it was acquired for, and a pass refuses a
lock that names a different account. This matters because the alternative, a
boolean or a comment saying "hold the lock around this call", is exactly the
shape that decays: a new surface calls the pass, nobody notices the missing
acquire, and there are two writers again. Anything that abandons undelivered
work takes the same lock for the same reason, since deleting rows a running drain
already snapshotted would report an abandonment that Gmail is concurrently being
told the opposite of.

Accounts remain independent. Each has its own reconciler, its own lock, and its
own `intent.db`, and their passes overlap freely.

### The product surface

Local Mail's writes are a **visible, bounded retry ledger**, not a silent sync.
Bounded by the user, not by a counter.

Status reports exactly three things, and adding a fourth is a decision, not a
detail:

- **The undelivered count.** Zero is the normal reading and it is stated, not
  implied by an absent warning.
- **The age of the oldest undelivered assertion**, from `asserted_at`. This is
  what turns "some pending work" into "something is wrong".
- **The current or most recent reconcile failure**, as one message. It is the
  running reconciler's last pass outcome, held in memory like every other pass
  result, never a stored column and never per assertion. The open app is the only
  process that has one, so it is the app's status route that carries it, not the
  shared status read the CLI and MCP also use.

Undelivered work can be discarded, wholesale. Discarding is complete: the rows
are removed, Gmail never sees them, and the read projection returns to the
mirror's own labels. Discarding is the only way an undelivered assertion leaves
without reaching Gmail, and it is deliberately the whole ledger rather than a
selection: the vocabulary the product has for pending work is a count and an age,
so a per-assertion picker would need a per-assertion listing that nothing else
justifies. It is refused without an explicit `--all`, because nothing else in the
system drops a recorded change, and refused outright while another owner holds
the account, because that is the window in which its report would be false.

Disconnecting an account must report its undelivered count first and discard it
on confirmation; a reauthorization is not a disconnect and retains everything.
Local Mail ships no disconnect verb today, so this binds that surface when one is
built rather than describing something that exists.

### What this refuses

- **`messages.batchModify`.** Google documents its response body as empty
  (verified 2026-08-01), so it returns no per-message acceptance proof. Under it,
  retirement would have to be inferred from a later `history.list` pull, which
  reintroduces exactly the ambiguity this record removes: a pass that cannot say
  which assertions landed cannot safely retire any of them, and a crash between
  the call and the next pull leaves the ledger unable to distinguish delivered
  from lost. The quota argument for it is real and is not the deciding one: 50
  units for up to 1,000 ids against 5 units each is a large saving at bulk
  scale. **The reopen condition is specific**: a design that preserves the
  acceptance proof, for instance by proving delivery from the following
  `history.list` window rather than from the call, applied only to assertions
  whose retirement can be deferred that long. That takes a new ADR, because it
  changes what "confirmed" means.
- **A retry schedule, backoff state, or dead-letter tier.** Nothing about
  delivery is stored, so there is nothing to schedule from and nowhere for a
  permanently-failing row to be filed. A failure is either about the pass, in
  which case the next wake retries, or about one message, in which case the
  assertion is discarded immediately.
- **Automatic expiry of undelivered work.** No age threshold, no attempt ceiling,
  no quiet cleanup. Delivery and discard are the only exits.
- **Background delivery after the app closes.** No daemon, no wake-on-timer, no
  handoff to another process (ADR-0116).
- **A second Gmail writer of any kind.** Not a retry worker, not a fast path for
  a single click, not a direct call from an MCP tool for the case that "obviously
  cannot conflict".
- **Cross-account atomicity.** A pass is one account's. An act that spanned
  accounts succeeds or fails per account and reports per account.

## Consequences

- **The invariant is checkable.** After this lands, exactly one module names
  Gmail's write endpoints, and any new call site is visible in review and in a
  grep. Today the writer is wherever a handler happened to call.
- **A click stops being a network round trip.** Asserting is a local SQLite
  write, so the UI responds at disk speed and the read projection already shows
  the effect. This is what lets the browser-memory projection be deleted rather
  than replaced.
- **Delivery latency is now a poll interval in the worst case.** A write made
  just after a pass waits for the next wake. Coalesced write-wakes make the
  common case immediate; the guarantee is the interval.
- **Two failure surfaces collapse into one.** A failed write used to be a toast
  the user might miss. It is now a count, an age, and one current failure
  message, which is the same shape as a failed pull and is read the same way. It
  also stops depending on somebody watching: the failure a background pass hits
  reaches the status line, where a per-click toast could only fire for a click.
- **The app cannot say which pending assertion is the problem.** With no per-row
  error there is no "this one failed" answer, only "delivery is not succeeding,
  here is why". Accepted, because the failures that persist are systemic and
  belong to the pass; the per-message ones do not persist at all. If a real case
  ever needs per-row attribution, it takes a new record, because the column it
  would add is the first half of a dead-letter table.
- **The `MessageWriteOutcome` vocabulary goes away.** `folded`, `aborted`, and
  per-id error summaries described a request that talked to Gmail. An assert
  returns what it stored. Delivery outcomes are read from the ledger.
- **A quota argument is being declined at bulk scale.** Archiving a thousand
  messages costs 5,000 units instead of 50, so a very large bulk act can pace
  itself against the per-minute ceiling. That is a real cost, named here rather
  than discovered later, and it is the one thing the batchModify reopen condition
  exists to revisit.
- **Reads keep working when writes do not**, which is the property that makes an
  offline reader with a pending ledger honest instead of merely broken quietly.

## Considered alternatives

- **Keep writing to Gmail from the request path and add durability only as a
  retry-on-failure fallback.** Rejected. It keeps two writers (the request and
  the retry), so the interleaving that corrupts a newer opinion stays possible,
  and it means the success path and the failure path apply intent differently.
- **A dedicated delivery worker separate from the sync loop.** Rejected. Two
  owners per account is the thing this record exists to remove: they would need a
  shared lock to avoid a write landing mid-pull, and once they share a lock they
  are one owner with extra scheduling.
- **Pull first, then drain.** Rejected. The pull would fold Gmail's pre-write
  labels over the mirror while the user's assertion is still pending, so a
  correctly-projected list would flicker on every pass until delivery.
- **Retire by `(message_id, label_id)` alone.** Rejected. It discards an opinion
  asserted while a delivery was in flight, which is exactly the fast-undo case.
- **Keep an `attempts` counter and a `last_error` per assertion.** Rejected, and
  this was the shape an earlier draft of this record carried. Those two columns
  are what a dead-letter table is made of: once a row can hold a failure, it
  needs a threshold, the threshold needs a terminal state, the terminal state
  needs a place to sit and a policy to clear it, and the partial map has become
  the queue ADR-0198 refused. They also answer a question nobody can act on: a
  persistent failure is systemic and identical for every row, so N copies of one
  error string is noise, and a per-message failure is discarded rather than
  retried and so never accumulates a count. One pass-level failure message
  carries the same information.
- **Expire undelivered assertions after an age or an attempt ceiling.**
  Rejected. It silently drops a write the user made, which is the one thing a
  durable ledger exists to prevent, and it converts a visible problem into an
  invisible one at precisely the moment the problem has lasted long enough to
  matter.
- **Use `batchModify` and confirm from the next `history.list`.** Not rejected on
  merit, deferred with a named condition above. It is a different definition of
  confirmed and deserves its own record rather than a footnote in this one.
- **Deliver a whole thread in one call.** Rejected. Google documents
  `users.threads.modify` as "this applies to all messages in the thread"
  (verified 2026-08-01), meaning the thread as Gmail sees it at delivery time,
  including messages that arrived after the user acted. That is the
  standing-target semantics ADR-0198 refuses, bought back at the delivery layer.
