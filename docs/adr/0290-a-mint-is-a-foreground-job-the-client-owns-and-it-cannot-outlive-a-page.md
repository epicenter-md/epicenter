# 0290. A mint is a foreground job the client owns, and it cannot outlive a page

- **Status:** Superseded
- **Date:** 2026-08-29
- **Amended by:** [ADR-0295](0295-a-database-is-one-yjs-document-and-a-row-holds-its-rich-content.md) at its per-document completeness precondition, which cannot arise when a database is one document.
- **Superseded by:** [ADR-0293](0293-a-generation-is-created-by-importing-a-folder-and-the-ledger-row-is-its-existence.md) at the mint upload and publication protocol.
- **Amends:** [ADR-0286](0286-every-generation-is-minted-from-an-artifact-and-compaction-is-an-export-then-an-import.md) at three points. Its invariant 5 said a `409` means abandon; a resumable mint would also need `409` to mean "skip, already sent", and this refuses resumption so the status keeps one meaning. Its invariant 7's pacing gains an owner and loses a deadline. And its Decision bullet 1 still names ADR-0267's layout (`tables/<table>.json` + `documents/<table>/<row>.<ext>`) where its own invariant 2 names the shipped one; **`<table>/<rowId>.md` plus `kv.json` is correct**, per ADR-0268 and `packages/data/src/artifact/layout.ts`.
- **Amends:** [ADR-0283](0283-a-generations-collection-is-a-ledger-that-allocates-admits-and-sweeps.md) at two words in its minting paragraph. "The client uploads documents by `PUT`, in parallel and **resumably**" loses the last word, for the reason below. And "a bad mint is a visible ledger row a person deletes" survives only as far as ADR-0287 lets it: there is no `DELETE`, so an abandoned number is inert rather than removable. Its route table is unchanged, and this record calls only `POST` on the collection, `PUT` on a document, and `PUT` on the generation.
- **Relates:** [ADR-0284](0284-the-application-document-is-an-index-and-a-rows-remaining-fields-live-in-its-own-document.md) (the row ceiling this lands beside), [ADR-0289](0289-the-folder-is-where-a-generation-is-minted-from-not-a-surface-kept-current-for-its-own-sake.md).
- **Unbuilt:** all of it. `renderArtifact`, `readArtifact`, and `record.documents()` exist; the completeness precondition, the routes it and the mint call, and the upload loop do not. The precondition cannot be built ahead of the ledger, because its other operand is a route.

## Context

ADR-0286 says a generation is minted from an artifact and that the mint paces itself, because creating tens of thousands of Durable Object stubs in a burst is rate-limited. It does not say who runs the loop, what happens when that party goes away, or what a device must hold before it is allowed to start.

Those gaps are load-bearing. Pacing is what makes a mint take minutes, and a mint that takes minutes has to survive something. Either the client stays present for the duration, or the bytes are handed to a server that finishes without it, and the second option is a different system: it needs a container format for many documents in one body, which is `envelope.ts` returning; it gives the ledger a second job as a bytes store; and it introduces the first thing in this design that outlives a page.

The gap about what a device holds is worse, because it is silent. Row documents are lazy, and a replica that never fetched one is indistinguishable from one whose document is genuinely empty. So a phone that never opened 4,000 notes renders 4,000 files with correct frontmatter and empty bodies, and mints a generation that is complete, well-formed, joinable, and blank.

## Decision

**A mint is a foreground job owned by the client, bounded by one page lifetime, never resumed, and never refused for taking too long.**

- **The client runs the whole loop.** It parses the artifact, runs the codec, allocates the number, uploads every row document, and puts the application document last. The authority receives encoded bytes at addresses it does not interpret. There is no server-side drain, no job, no queue, and no bundle: `POST /generations` still carries no data (ADR-0286 invariant 1), and each document is still its own `PUT` (ADR-0283).
- **A mint refuses to start unless the device holds every body, and it asks the authority what that means.** Before the first request, the client compares `record.documents()` against the address register the source generation's ledger keeps (ADR-0283). Any address the authority has admitted and this device holds no chain for is a body that was never fetched, and the mint stops.

  The obvious cheaper check does not work, and the reason is a property this design relies on everywhere else: an unwritten document and an empty one are the same document (ADR-0284), and a row carries no marker saying whether it has one, because the document lives at the row's derived address rather than inside the row (`packages/data/src/store/document.ts`). So locally, a note you created and never typed in is indistinguishable from a note whose body this device never downloaded, and comparing `record.documents()` against "every row in a table with a `document` block" would refuse a mint for any store containing an empty note. There is also no "fully synced" state to consult; documents arrive lazily and nothing records that they all have.

  The authority is therefore the only party that can answer, and this is what its address register is for. ADR-0287 left that register justified only by account erasure; it now has a live consumer.
- **A mint is never resumed.** If the page goes away, the mint is over. The partially filled number keeps whatever landed, has no application document, and is therefore unreachable by construction. A person mints again at a fresh number, and ADR-0287's refusal to delete means the abandoned one is inert rather than in the way.
- **There is no duration ceiling and no estimate a mint enforces.** Restore is the one path that exists to get a person's data back, and an escape hatch that refuses to run is worse than a slow one. The mint paces itself against the platform, reports progress, and takes as long as it takes.
- **A mint may hold an exclusive lock.** Being foreground and client-owned means it rides the Web Lock mechanism `claims.ts` already uses, so two tabs cannot mint at once without a server-side lease.

## Consequences

- **`409` has one meaning again**, which is the concrete payoff: abandon. No skip-and-continue arm, no record of which documents were already sent, no cross-session idempotency.
- **A generation still has two states, both derived**: allocated, and complete because its application document exists. No `minting` flag, no progress resource, no alarm. Progress is a bar in a window.
- **The ledger holds no bytes**, as ADR-0283 designed it. Allocator, browse list, address register.
- **The artifact may be held in memory for the duration**, so nothing needs streaming or chunked upload. The ceiling is a browser tab, which is the ceiling ADR-0284 already declares.
- **Minting is effectively a desktop verb.** iOS suspends backgrounded tabs, so "keep this window open" is a stronger demand on a phone. Stated here rather than discovered.
- **Abandoned mints cost storage forever**, at ADR-0287's ~12 KB per-object floor for whatever rows landed. Noise at a few; worth watching if someone retries a failing mint repeatedly.
- **The duration is unmeasured and deliberately so.** The client half is cheap: encoding 30,000 row documents measured 0.4 s and 39.8 MB, about 1.3 KB per document. The unknown is Cloudflare's rate limit on creating objects that have never existed, which cannot be measured without a real namespace. If it is ever low enough that a mint takes hours, this record is what a successor supersedes, and the server-drained mint is the fallback whose costs are named above.

## Considered alternatives

- **`POST` the zip and let a Worker fan out.** A stateless Worker genuinely can fan out; the documented paid subrequest budget is 10,000, configurable far higher, so the topology objection this record originally leaned on does not hold. It loses on the codec: `file.deserialize` is a function in an application's bundle closing over its editor schema, so a server that reads Markdown runs application code, which is the coupling ADR-0277 spent the redesign refusing. Once the client must run the codec anyway, the only question left is transport.
- **Upload a bundle so a server can finish without the client.** This is the honest case for a batch, and it is a handoff of responsibility rather than an optimisation. Refused because it would be the first thing here that outlives a page, and because it costs a container format, a second home for a document's bytes, and a drain lifecycle.
- **Batch to reduce round trips.** Undercut by pacing: if the destination's object-creation rate is the bottleneck, a fan-out creates the same objects and relocates the throttle without relieving it.
- **Enforce a duration ceiling from a pre-flight estimate.** All the inputs exist. Refused because it turns a patience estimate into a wall on the recovery path.
