# 0172. SQLite stores convergent facts and documents; raw files store blob bytes

- **Relates:** [ADR-0171](0171-every-durable-local-write-leaves-an-automatic-authority-obligation.md)

## Context

Browser persistence is sometimes framed as a choice between SQLite and OPFS.
SQLite already lives in OPFS through the browser's SQLite VFS. The actual
choice is which data benefits from SQLite's transactional framing and which
data benefits from raw streaming files.

## Decision

One local Epicenter owner uses the same conceptual layout in every runtime:

```txt
Epicenter storage root
├── epicenter.sqlite3
│   ├── scalar state and pending intents
│   ├── Yjs document update logs
│   ├── document publication vectors
│   └── blob publication records
└── blobs/
    └── row-scoped immutable byte files
```

The browser stores this layout in OPFS and keeps one Worker-owned SQLite
connection behind the storage lease. Native runtimes use native SQLite and the
native filesystem with the same ownership law. OPFS is the filesystem; it is
not an alternative database engine.

SQLite owns small mutable records that require crash-safe framing, indexing,
compaction, schema versioning, row-liveness admission, or coordination with
scalar deletion. Yjs document updates therefore remain in the SQLite update
log. Epicenter does not invent raw per-document files, record framing,
truncation recovery, compaction swaps, or cross-medium row-liveness checks.

Raw files own blob bytes because blobs are immutable, potentially large, and
streamed. SQLite stores only the small row-addressed obligation needed to
publish those bytes. Filename, media type, application meaning, and other blob
interpretation belong to application citations, not sidecar metadata in the
blob store.

The SQLite row-deletion transaction ends the logical life of the row and
removes its document log and pending publication records. The owner then
deletes the row's blob directory idempotently. Raw bytes without a live row and
application citation are unreachable storage debris, never resurrectable
product state.

## Consequences

- Browser documents already receive OPFS durability through SQLite; moving
  them to raw OPFS files would add machinery rather than remove it.
- Scalar deletion, document deletion, and publication cancellation share one
  transaction even though potentially large blob bytes stay outside SQLite.
- Blob reads and writes can stream without loading a complete object into
  SQLite or across WebView JSON IPC.
- Browser and native runtimes share one storage law without pretending their
  filesystem adapters are one implementation.
- Blob-file cleanup may lag the logical deletion transaction. That lag costs
  storage only and cannot restore a deleted row.

## Considered alternatives

- **Store documents as raw OPFS files.** Rejected because it requires custom
  framing, torn-write recovery, compaction, versioning, and cross-medium
  lifecycle reconciliation.
- **Store blob bytes inside SQLite.** Rejected because large immutable streams
  do not need relational mutation or transaction participation.
- **Keep browser blobs in IndexedDB.** Rejected because OPFS already owns the
  Epicenter storage root and raw files are the canonical representation the
  browser and native hosts can share.
- **Store blob metadata beside the bytes.** Rejected because applications
  already own the citation that gives bytes their name, media type, and
  meaning.
