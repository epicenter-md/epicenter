/**
 * The Ark publisher kernel: the one owner of how a rendered projection
 * becomes public bytes.
 *
 * This module is trusted, private-side code. It is NOT imported by the public
 * Worker entry (src/index.ts), so the deployed public plane keeps zero write
 * paths; the kernel runs wherever an authenticated caller holds bucket
 * credentials (an operator CLI today, an authenticated endpoint only if one
 * is ever earned). The object store is injected so the whole orchestration is
 * provable in-memory without credentials or production resources.
 *
 * Invariants owned here, and nowhere else:
 * - Reserve-first, atomically: a publicly-unroutable `.artifact` marker
 *   claims the `<identity>/<slug>` subtree via create-if-absent before any
 *   public byte lands, so two racing publishers cannot both win. The marker
 *   records the private artifact id AND the immutable expression digest
 *   (Vault ADR-0064: idempotent inserts key on the expression digest, never
 *   `integrity_digest`). It is the entire collision registry: another
 *   artifact is refused the slug forever; the same artifact with a different
 *   frozen expression is refused (a permalink never changes its words); only
 *   an exact match converges. Generated HTML and media are deliberately NOT
 *   hashed, so theme rebuilds and free output rebuilds stay allowed.
 * - Route-last: generated media is written before `index.html`, so the page
 *   address only ever answers with its media already in place.
 * - Verification: every written object is read back and byte-compared before
 *   the kernel reports success. Public-URL verification stays with the
 *   caller, which knows the expected URL (the Vault port's contract).
 * - Route agreement: keys are derived through the delivery Worker's own
 *   `resolveProjection`, so the kernel cannot write an object the Worker
 *   would refuse to serve.
