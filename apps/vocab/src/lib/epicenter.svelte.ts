/**
 * The one thing this application reaches its entries and conversations
 * through.
 *
 * Two functions composed: `createEpicenter` knows nothing about Svelte,
 * `fromEpicenter` adapts it, and what comes back is the same epicenter with
 * its data session rendered as reactive state (ADR-0339, ADR-0344).
 *
 * It replaces `openVocabRuntime`, which was this application's own copy of the
 * opener: resolve the generation, open the database, attach sync, hand back a
 * disposer. One thing that copy did not do was ask the page for a flush before
 * it went, so the last few seconds of typing were lost with no error anywhere.
 * The shared opener owns that listener, which is the reason a straggler is
 * worth migrating rather than leaving alone.
 *
 * `definition` and `account` arrive together, which is the store: an authority
 * mints every generation (ADR-0336), so there is no accountless pool. The
 * explicit application id is the opening application's independent storage
 * scope (ADR-0324), and it is self-claimed: a deployed app is a trusted app
 * (ADR-0334).
 *
 * **Nothing opens when this module is evaluated.** What opens the store is
 * `epicenter.open()`, called once by `routes/+page.svelte` after auth is read.
