 * Practice is a session boundary, not an interjection. The compiled turn is
 * permanent conversation memory, so sending it into whatever thread happens to
 * be open would steer that thread for good; it gets its own conversation
 * instead, and the title is what makes that conversation findable afterwards.
 *
 * Deliberately language-neutral: it names no target or source language, so the
 * conversation's tutor persona stays the single owner of which language the
 * passage and its explanation come back in. That keeps the future language
 * profile seam in one place and this path free of language-specific strings.
 *
 * It reads only entry text and writes nothing. The compiled passage is an
 * ordinary assistant turn in the human-owned transcript, never entry metadata
 * (ADR-0102): no entry is marked practiced, and nothing is auto-saved back.
