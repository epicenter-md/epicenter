 * row id constant, a `settingFieldName` mapping from setting to column, and a
 * read that had to create the row when it was missing. Reads were asynchronous,
 * so there were per-key read generations, a `bumpGeneration` on every read and
 * write, an `isReleased` guard, and a background write queue that reconciled
 * `loadError` after the fact. Values came back live, so every read and write
 * ran `structuredClone`.
 *
 * KV is a reserved root, reads are synchronous, and a read hands back a plain
 * object or a conformance diagnostic (ADR-0213, ADR-0215, ADR-0216). So a read
 * is a read, a write names its keys, and application recovery handles missing
 * values without creating a row to hold them.
