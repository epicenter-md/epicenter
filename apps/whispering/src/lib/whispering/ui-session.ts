/**
 * Everything that lives for as long as the app UI is mounted, over a store that
 * already lives longer.
 *
 * **Two lifetimes, and this is the shorter one.** The replica is the document's
 * (ADR-0088): it is opened once by the `(app)` layout and ended by the
 * document being replaced when identity changes. A query client, a settings
 * view, a recordings projection, the manual-recording watcher, and the
 * push-to-talk registration are the UI's, so they are built when the boot
 * reaches `ready` and released when that subtree goes.
 *
 * It is synchronous, and that is the whole shape change. It used to be
 * `openWhisperingUiSession(dependencies, signal)`: an `await` over an opener
 * that acquired a store, wrapped in an `AbortSignal` because a route could
 * unmount mid-acquisition, rendered through an `{#await}`, and disposed by a
 * helper that existed to arbitrate the resolve-after-unmount race. Nothing here
 * acquires now, so there is no in-flight anything to abort and no race to
 * arbitrate.
