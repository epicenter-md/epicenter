/**
 * The one thing this application reaches its recordings and recipes through.
 *
 * Two functions composed: `createEpicenter` knows nothing about Svelte,
 * `fromEpicenter` adapts it, and what comes back is the same epicenter with its
 * data session rendered as reactive state (ADR-0339, ADR-0344). It is the same
 * file Honeycrisp and Vocab have, because it is the same composition.
 *
 * It replaces `openAccountRuntime`, which built a handle inside
 * `openWhisperingApp` on every `(app)` mount, awaited `open()`, and unwound the
 * result by hand when an `AbortSignal` fired mid-open. A handle per mount is
 * one handle too many for a document: opening is idempotent while `ready`
 * (ADR-0344), so the mount that used to build a rival now joins the session
 * this module owns.
 *
 * **This file is not a platform leaf, and there is one of it.** Nothing about
 * a data session varies by runtime: the store is client-owned in every build
 * (ADR-0226, ADR-0227), the definition is one file, and the account is already
 * selected next door.
 *
 * **Nothing opens when this module is evaluated.** What opens the store is
 * `epicenter.open()`, called once by `(app)/+layout.svelte` after auth is read.
 * `/auth/callback` and `/recording-overlay` are siblings of that group and
 * never reach it (ADR-0345).
