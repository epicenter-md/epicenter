/**
 * Which build gets which leaf.
 *
 * Whispering's seams split on one axis: `epicenter-host` when the Bun host
 * owns the thing behind the seam, `default` when the page does, which is the
 * `bun dev:whispering` browser tab (ADR-0347). Every other `#platform/*` entry
 * is a plain path alias to one module, because ADR-0227 refused the build that
 * used to choose.
 *
 * The failure this guards is silent. Drop the `epicenter-host` leaf from a seam
 * and resolution falls back to `default`, so the host-served build would go
 * looking for a credential only a browser can obtain, while still building and
 * still starting. This reads the declarations, so it says which seam lost a
 * leaf in milliseconds.
