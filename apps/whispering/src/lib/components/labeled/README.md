# Labeled Components

These are convenience wrapper components that provide a standardized way to combine labels with form elements throughout the application. Each component handles the consistent layout, spacing, and accessibility patterns for pairing a label with its corresponding input, select, textarea, or switch element.

By using these components, we ensure uniform styling and behavior across all forms while reducing code duplication. They support common features like descriptions, action slots for buttons, and visibility controls, making it easy to build accessible and consistent form interfaces.
