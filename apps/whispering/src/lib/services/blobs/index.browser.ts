 *
 * A factory rather than a module-level value, because the local store is the
 * account's: it lives at `epicenter/v5/<app-id>/<principal-id>/blobs`
 * (ADR-0349), beside that account's replica, so it cannot exist until the
 * shell knows which account opened. Two people on one browser profile get two
 * stores, and neither can reach the other's recordings.
 *
 * This module still owns remote availability: the capability exists only
 * while the session is signed in, so callers check one owner instead of
 * pairing a platform null with auth state.
