<!--
	Everything that exists because the store is open: the UI session, its typed
	context, its query client, and the whole of the app chrome.

	Mounted only from the `ready` branch of the (app) layout's boot, so `data` is
	an open store from the moment this initialises. The session is built during
	initialisation, its context is supplied synchronously, and the session-owned
	TanStack client is installed for the descendant tree.

	**It does not open the store, and it must not.** Opening belongs to the boot
	node, which is the narrowest node not shared with `/auth/callback`
	(ADR-0345); an open that slid down here would still build and still pass
	every other test, which is what `boot-node.test.ts` pins. That test matches
	on source text, so do not write the call in this comment either.

	It owns the teardown for exactly what it built. The replica underneath is NOT
	its to close: that is the document's (ADR-0088), and `$lib/epicenter.svelte.ts`
	holds the only reference that could end it.

	This absorbed `WhisperingUiSessionProvider`, which was a component wrapping
	one `createWhisperingUiSession` call. It existed because the layout had no
	shell to put the session in, unlike Honeycrisp's `StoreShell` and Vocab's
	`VocabShell`, which both do this inline. Now there is one.
