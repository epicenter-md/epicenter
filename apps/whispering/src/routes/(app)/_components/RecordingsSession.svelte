	 * Sign out, and remove this account's recordings and their audio from this
	 * device.
	 *
	 * The ORDER is the design, and it is Honeycrisp's with one more step.
	 * Capture the principal while a client still names one, close the session
	 * so the erase can take the lock, clear the credential, delete the
	 * generations, THEN delete the audio (ADR-0349: a second explicit delete
	 * against the same captured principal, never a widened filter). Clearing
	 * before deleting is what makes an interrupted removal safe on a shared
	 * device, and removal is idempotent, so a retry is the same call.
	 *
	 * The audio scope is read off the opened replica, the same stamp the blob
	 * store was built from, not off auth: by the time the audio delete runs the
	 * credential is already gone and a client read would name nobody.
	 *
	 * **It does not reopen.** A failed removal leaves what is still there, and
	 * the popover reports the failure; reopening would show a person who asked
	 * for their data to be gone that same data.
	 *
	 * Defined only where the platform can remove one account's audio and leave
	 * another's, which is the browser build today. The desktop leaf exports
	 * null, and the popover then offers plain sign-out and nothing else.
