<!--
	The (app) route layout is the boot node: the narrowest node that is NOT
	shared with `/auth/callback` or `/recording-overlay` (ADR-0345). It mounts
	once per launch and persists across navigation inside the group, so the
	store is opened once and the UI session is built once.

	**This node decides who is looking; the session component opens.** Whispering
	has many routes at `/`, so its protected surface is a group and the boot is
	this layout rather than a page: `/auth/callback` and `/recording-overlay` are
	siblings of the group and never reach it (ADR-0345).

	The auth read TRACKS. A sign-out flips the `{#if}` and the session's cleanup
	closes; a different principal remounts the `{#key}`; a credential degrading
	to `reauth-required` changes neither, so a person keeps recording while sync
	reports the refusal (ADR-0350). Signing in is a door (ADR-0342, rejected):
	nothing opens while signed out, because a recording that was never anywhere
	is the loss this refuses to allow.
