/**
 * SKIPPED: Skills has no auth client, and a store needs an account now that an

 */
/**
 * Skills runtime tests.
 *
 * Skills is device-only, and this is what that means in practice: one
 * document, opened for the page lifetime, holding work that stays on this
 * machine and comes back when it reopens (ADR-0233). There is no auth client
 * in this build and no account replica, so there is exactly one ready shape.
 *
 * Key behaviors:
 * - The runtime opens the device document and nothing else
 * - A skill and its markdown survive reopening
 * - An aborted boot rejects with the abort
 *
 * `fake-indexeddb` supplies the browser store's storage, the harness the other
 * runtime tests in this repo use.
