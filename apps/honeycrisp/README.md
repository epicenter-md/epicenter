# Honeycrisp

Honeycrisp is a local-first notes app. Folder and note metadata live as canonical SQLite rows. Each note body is a Yjs document that can sync and merge independently.

## How it works

### Layout

Single-route SvelteKit app with a three-pane layout: sidebar (folders) → note list → editor. SSR is disabled; the app runs entirely in the browser as a static site.

### Data layer

Honeycrisp defines one inert workspace contract (`id: "epicenter-honeycrisp"`) and opens it through a page-owned runtime:

```txt
honeycrispLens
  shared isomorphic definition: id and release-local row lenses

openHoneycrispBrowserEpicenter()
  browser runtime: device or account SQLite ownership and sync
```

The Svelte app chooses its authority once at boot. Signed out, it opens the device database. Signed in, it opens the account database and attaches the account transport. Row changes invalidate app-owned reactive arrays; the state layer refreshes them through the async table API.

This was a clean break from the legacy root-Yjs and IndexedDB model. Honeycrisp does not probe, import, restore, or delete legacy data. The old database is untouched and unreachable from the new app.

### Rich-text editing

Each note row owns one document. `NoteBodyPane.svelte` opens it through `honeycrisp.openNoteDocument(noteId)`, reads the application-owned `body` root, and disposes the handle when the pane unmounts. ProseMirror binds to that Yjs 14 type through `@y/prosemirror`.

User edits extract the title, preview, and word count and write them back to the note row with an explicit `updatedAt`. Binding-origin transactions do not update metadata, so opening or remotely hydrating a note does not make it look newly edited.

### Soft deletion

Normal deletion is soft deletion: the note row gets a `deletedAt` timestamp and appears in Recently Deleted. Permanent deletion removes the canonical row and revokes its document lease.

### Auth

Google sign-in is optional. The app opens immediately against device storage. A principal change reloads the page so the next boot can choose the account or device runtime. There is no legacy sign-in migration or restore prompt.

## Workspace schema

**Workspace ID:** `epicenter-honeycrisp`

### Tables

**`folders`**
| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `id` | `string` (runtime-minted) |
| `name` | `string` |
| `icon` | `string` (optional) |
| `sortOrder` | `number` |

**`notes`**
| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `id` | `string` (runtime-minted) |
| `folderId` | `FolderId` (optional) |
| `title` | `string` |
| `preview` | `string` |
| `pinned` | `boolean` |
| `createdAt` | `InstantString` |
| `updatedAt` | `InstantString` |
| `deletedAt` | `InstantString` (optional, soft delete) |
| `wordCount` | `number` (optional) |

Each note's body lives in a row-owned document opened by `honeycrisp.openNoteDocument(noteId)`. The editor owns the `body` root name and the handle's lifecycle.

Honeycrisp currently has no workspace KV schema. View selection, sorting, and URL state live in the Svelte state layer.

## Other features

- **Pin/unpin**: pinned notes sort to the top of the list.
- **Folder deletion**: re-parents all notes in the folder to unfiled, keeping data intact.
- **Sorting**: by date edited, date created, or title.
- **Search**: filters by title and preview content.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: `Cmd+N` (new note), `Cmd+Shift+N` (new folder).
- **Context menus**: per-note actions: pin, move to folder, delete, restore.

## Development

Prerequisites: [Bun](https://bun.sh).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EpicenterHQ/epicenter.git
cd epicenter
bun install
bun dev:honeycrisp
```

This starts the desktop app on port 5175 alongside the local API on `localhost:8787`, which auth and sync expect. `bun dev:honeycrisp:ui` runs the browser UI without the API or Tauri shell.

### Manual two-client check

To exercise two independent browser replicas, open the Honeycrisp web UI in two
isolated browser profiles. Point both at one self-hosted authority that includes
the UI origin in `TRUSTED_BROWSER_ORIGINS`. Do not use two ordinary tabs in one
profile: they share a storage partition, so the second owner is refused by
design (ADR-0177).
