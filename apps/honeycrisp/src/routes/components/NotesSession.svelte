	 * Svelte creating the new keyed branch before destroying the old one: the
	 * handle serializes, so this open runs after the previous session's release.

	 * then delete. Clearing before deleting is what makes an interrupted removal
	 * safe on a shared device: the next person meets a sign-in door rather than
	 * the owner's notes, and the owner signing back in sees what is left and
	 * removes again.
	 *
	 * **It does not reopen.** A failed removal leaves the copy that is still
	 * there, and reopening it would be this component deciding that a person who
	 * asked for their data to be gone should be shown it again. The popover
	 * reloads on success and reports the failure otherwise.
