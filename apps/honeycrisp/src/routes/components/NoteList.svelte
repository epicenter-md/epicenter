	 * work (the store admits an update to a row it cannot read, which is how a

	 * has is the file, and half a menu that pins a note nobody can open is not
	 * the other half.
	 *
	 * A push from the folder can produce one on purpose, so one broken note
	 * among a hundred has to be visible with the ninety-nine rather than only
	 * when the list is otherwise empty.
	 *
	 * Unfiltered by the folder, the query, and the deleted view alike. Which of
	 * those a note belongs in is read off values this release could not read, so
	 * hiding it under any of them is how it becomes invisible again. The count
	 * beside the title stays the count of notes this release reads, for the same
	 * reason: it counts a list, and these are not in it.
