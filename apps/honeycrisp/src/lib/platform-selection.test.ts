/**
 * Which build gets which credential.
 *
 * Honeycrisp has three: the hosted web SPA, the standalone desktop bundle, and
 * the build the desktop Epicenter host serves. What separates them is auth and
 * the deployment they talk to, and NOT their storage: every build owns its own
 * store and reaches the same authority per account (ADR-0226), so there is no
 * `#platform/application` seam any more and nothing here asserts one.
 *
 * The failure this guards is silent. Drop the `epicenter-host` leaf from a seam
 * and resolution falls back to `default`, so the host-served build would go
 * looking for a credential only a browser can obtain, while still building and
 * still starting. Nothing downstream would complain. These assertions complain
 * instead.
 *
 * This is the cheap structural half: it reads declarations, so it can say
 * exactly which seam lost its host leaf, in milliseconds. What it cannot do is
 * prove the build honored them. That is
 * `apps/epicenter/scripts/build-applications.test.ts`, which runs the real build
 * and reads the emitted bytes.
