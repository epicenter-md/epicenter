/**
 * The reactive Honeycrisp application, for one mounted app generation.
 *
 * The opened database is a route's yield: one document, optional attached
 * sync, and the disposal that closes it (ADR-0233). This is the application
 * built on top of that one document, and the one object the UI consumes. It
 * owns the reactive named tables over that document (`fromData`),
 * Honeycrisp's domain operations (`tables.notes`, `tables.folders`), the one
 * derivation that needs both those tables and where the user is
 * (`visibleNotes`), and the narrow account and store capabilities the UI
 * actually needs.
 *
 * The store's own handles do not cross this boundary. `tables.notes` and
 * `tables.folders` are the whole vocabulary a component gets, and they are
 * this application's verbs rather than the store's, so nothing downstream can
 * reach a raw write verb or the `kv` root. The container keeps the name the
 * data uses, because these are those tables: one shape to learn, at both
 * levels.
 *
 * Where the user is looking is deliberately NOT here. That lives in the URL,
 * and `navigation.svelte.ts` is its module singleton, imported directly by the
 * components that navigate. A note selection is not a fact about which
 * document is open, so routing it through this object bought a rename and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * The route chooses the document before this function is called. There is no
 * fallback and no account/local decision below this boundary.
 *
 * One instance per mounted route generation, created by the route's provider
 * and reached through `getHoneycrisp`, never a module-global singleton.
 * Nothing here needs disposing, and not because anything is ref-counted: the
 * adapter holds each table's projection and its subscription for as long as
 * the document is open, and both die with it.

/**

 * needs a value that fails its declared field descriptor, and every value this file
 * writes is statically that type: a `boolean` into `'boolean'`, an
 * `InstantString.now()` into `'string.date.iso'`. That leaves `RowAbsent`,
 * which means another device deleted the row between the render and the click.
 *
 * That one is ordinary, and this app already ruled on it twice:
 * `permanentlyDelete` calls an absent row "a no-op fact, not an error", and
 * `togglePin` returns early on one. The reactive list is about to drop the row
 * on its own, so a sentence would only ask the person to care about a race they
 * cannot lose. Silence is the honest answer, and it is what deleted the toast
 * wrapper every call site used to carry.
 *
 * It is also the ONLY one. `update` refuses an absent address and nothing else,
 * which the `UpdateRowError` alias used to hide: this function's `throw` was
 * documented as catching two other failures where a declaration and this file
 * disagree, and neither exists. The throw is unreachable today and stays
 * anyway, because a variant the store grows later should surface here rather
