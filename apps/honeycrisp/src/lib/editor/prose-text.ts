/**
 * Plain text read off a note's prose, without rebuilding the note.
 *
 * A note's body is a nested `Y.Type` in the document this store already holds
 * (ADR-0295), so the list can read what it needs directly. It used to read a
 * `preview` scalar the editor wrote back on every change, because a body lived
 * in its own lazily loaded document (ADR-0248) and a list could not afford to
 * open one per row. That reason is gone.
 *
 * **Everything here goes through `slice`, and that is the whole point.**
 * `YType.slice` walks the item list and returns as soon as it has the count it
 * was asked for (`typeListSlice`, `@y/y` 14.0.0-rc.24 `src/ytype.js`), so
 * reading a hundred characters costs a hundred characters. `toString`,
 * `toArray`, `forEach`, `map` and `toJSON` all route through `toDelta` and
 * materialize the entire subtree, so `body.toString().slice(0, 100)` would pay
 * the cost of the whole note on every render. It looks like the obvious
 * spelling and it is the expensive one.
 *
 * `slice` yields a text run as a plain string and a nested element as a
 * `Y.Type`, which is the same discriminant `toString` uses internally, so
 * walking it needs nothing from ProseMirror.
