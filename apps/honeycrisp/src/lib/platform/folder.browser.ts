 * There is no `~/Epicenter` folder in a browser tab.

 * a person in an ordinary browser never meets the button, rather than meeting
 * one that always fails.
 *
 * Typed as the capability it is missing rather than as `undefined`, so both
 * leaves state one contract and a caller writes `openWorkingCopy?.(data)`
 * whichever build it is reading.
