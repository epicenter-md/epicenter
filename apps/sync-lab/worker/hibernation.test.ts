/**
 * A Durable Object is really evicted, its sockets really survive, and the
 * test peers on the other end really converge.
 *
 * The wake path in `worker/index.ts` is the only code on this branch that had
 * never executed. It cannot be reached from `wrangler dev`, which will not evict
 * on demand, and reaching it against deployed Cloudflare means waiting on an
 * eviction timer nobody controls. `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` exposes
 * `evictDurableObject`, which tears the instance down while HIBERNATING its
 * WebSockets rather than closing them, which is exactly the transition.
 *
 * ## The control every test here carries
 *
 * `stat().incarnation` is minted once per constructor. A hibernation test that
 * silently failed to evict would satisfy every convergence assertion below while
 * testing nothing at all, so each test reads the incarnation across its
 * eviction and requires it to have CHANGED, and a paired control runs the same
 * traffic without an eviction and requires it to be the SAME. Without the second
 * half, "it changed" is also what a per-call random value looks like.
 *
 * Convergence is asserted on the receiving test peer's own rows, read back
 * through the Workspace out of its own SQLite, never on a count the test kept.
 * The peer runs the real Store and sync client, but it is not a browser-storage
 * simulation: browser persistence is covered separately in `packages/data`.
 * The only numbers this file keeps are re-delivery observations, because a run
 * that re-sent nothing and a run that re-sent and was correctly ignored converge
 * identically.
