/**
 * Opensidian workspace contract: id, branded types, tables, base actions, and
 * per-row child document models. Isomorphic: no IndexedDB, WebSockets, Svelte
 * state, browser shell APIs, or daemon process lifecycle.
 *
 * Distribution: `apps/opensidian/package.json` exports this file as the
 * `opensidian` package root. Browser code, daemon code, and tests all import
 * from here. The table shapes here are the wire contract for sync; forking a
 * column shape breaks sync compatibility with peers running the canonical
 * schema.
 *
 * Composition lives elsewhere:
 *  - `apps/opensidian/opensidian.browser.ts` -> `openOpensidianBrowser({ signedIn, nodeId })`
 *  - `apps/opensidian/mount.ts`                      -> `opensidian()` mount factory
