/**
 * The reconciler: one pass per account, and the only thing in Local Mail that
 * writes to Gmail (ADR-0199). A pass is always the same two phases in the same
 * order.
 *
 *     drain  ->  pull
 *
 * Drain delivers the durable assertions in `intent.db`, folding each accepted
 * response into the mirror and retiring the assertion it proved. Pull is the
 * existing sync pass, unchanged. The order is the point: delivering after a pull
 * would leave a window where the mirror says one thing, the intent store says
 * another, and Gmail has heard neither.
 *
 * Who may run a pass is the account lock (`lock.ts`), and a pass ASKS FOR IT
 * rather than trusting the caller to have taken one: `reconcileAccount` requires
 * a `ReconcileLock`, which only `acquireReconcileLock` can produce and only for
 * one named account. That is the same lock the sync loop already took, widened
 * from "one puller" to "one writer", and moved out of convention into the
 * signature: a delivery landing between two pages of a pull, or a second process
 * writing behind the first one's back, is refused by the type rather than by
 * every call site remembering.
 *
 * Failure handling has exactly two shapes, and no state is persisted for either:
 *
 * - The provider refuses the request (400/404). That names the request, not
 *   necessarily every assertion inside it, so a rejected group is retried one
 *   assertion at a time and only the individually rejected one is resolved. A
 *   resolved assertion is retired and reported in this pass's `discarded` list,
 *   which is the whole record of it: nothing about the refusal is written to
 *   disk, because a dead-letter row would be state nobody reads back.
 * - Anything else (auth, throttling, network, 5xx) is systemic. Delivery stops
 *   where it is, every undelivered assertion stays exactly as it was, and the
 *   next pass tries again. No attempt counter, because the retry policy is "the
 *   next pass", not a function of how many passes came before.
 *
 * Assertions are handled independently: one message's rejection never stops
 * another's, and within a message the trash transition and the label change are
 * separate deliveries, ordered so each still means what the user meant (see the
 * drain loop).
 *
 * A group Gmail refuses for being too large is not special-cased: the same
 * split retry that handles one impossible label delivers each assertion on its
 * own, so an accumulation past Gmail's 100-label-per-direction request cap
 * still lands.
