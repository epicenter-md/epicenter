/**
 * The reconciler: one pass per account, and the only thing in Local Mail that
 * writes to Gmail (ADR-0199). A pass is always the same two phases in the same
 * order.
 *
 *     drain  ->  pull
 *
 * Drain delivers the durable assertions in the intent store, folding each accepted
 * response into the cache and retiring the assertion it proved. Pull is the
 * existing sync pass, unchanged. The order is the point: delivering after a pull
 * would leave a window where the cache says one thing, the intent store says
 * another, and Gmail has heard neither.
 *
 * **A pass is somebody's own two hands, and `reconcileNow` in `accounts.ts` is
 * the only way to ask for one.** Local Mail does not reconcile in the
 * background: it reconciles when the application opens, when a person records
 * triage, and when a person presses Retry. So there is no scheduler, no worker,
 * and nothing that can start a pass while another is running except a second
 * gesture, which `reconcileNow` joins to the pass already in flight rather than
 * racing. This module is the pass itself and holds none of that.
 *
 * This used to require a `ReconcileClaim` that only a claim module could mint,
 * back when the writers were a CLI watch loop, an MCP server, and a desktop
 * host. One entry point in one process is a stronger guarantee than a token
 * every call site had to remember to take, so the token is gone.
 *
 * Failure handling has exactly two shapes:
 *
 * - The provider refuses the request (400/404). That names the request, not
 *   necessarily every assertion inside it, so a rejected group is retried one
 *   assertion at a time and only the individually rejected one is resolved. A
 *   resolved assertion is retired and reported in this pass's `discarded` list.
 * - Anything else (auth, throttling, network, 5xx) is systemic. Delivery stops
 *   where it is, every undelivered assertion stays exactly as it was, and the
 *   next pass tries again.
 *
 * **Both shapes end up written down.** A pass records what it did in
 * `last_pass` before it returns, so a failure is still on screen after the
 * window that saw it was closed and reopened (ADR-0327). The return value is
 * the same facts for the caller that is still there; the record is what a
 * person comes back to. What a failure means for a person, which is whether
 * pressing Retry could help, is decided in `outbox.ts`.
 *
 * Assertions are handled independently: one message's rejection never stops
 * another's, and within a message the trash transition and the label change are
 * separate deliveries, ordered so each still means what the user meant (see the
 * drain loop).
 *
 * A group Gmail refuses for being too large is not special-cased: the same
 * split retry that handles one impossible label delivers each assertion on its
 * own, so an accumulation past Gmail's 100-label-per-direction request cap
 * still lands.

/**
 * Everything one account's work needs.
 *
 * `openSession` in `accounts.ts` builds one, and it is the only thing that

 * name `MailSession`, with identical fields; the tell was a caller writing
 * `{ ...openSession(app, id), sub }` over a spread that already carried
 * `sub`.
 *
 * `sub` is on it so a session names the account it was opened for. Nothing in a
 * pass reads it: `intents` and `passes` are already scoped, and `reconcileNow`
 * keys its in-flight map by the subject it was asked for. It is here because a
 * session held in a map, printed in a log, or read in a test should say which
 * mailbox it is, and because the alternative is a second account's session
