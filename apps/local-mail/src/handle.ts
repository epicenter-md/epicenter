/**
 * Reading and writing one application SQLite database, as this application
 * wants to hold it.
 *
 * `AppSqliteDatabase` answers with a `Result` on every call, which is right at
 * the seam: a storage owner can refuse and the application has to be told. It
 * is wrong INSIDE a store, where every statement is one step of an operation
 * that is already fallible as a whole. Both stores wrote the same three
 * unwrapping closures to get from one to the other, and neither wanted the
 * difference.
 *
 * So a refusal throws here and the store's caller catches it once. That is the
 * same bargain `syncMailbox` already makes with `SQLITE_BUSY`: a lock lost to a
 * concurrent writer is an outcome the pass reports, not a value every statement
 * has to thread.
