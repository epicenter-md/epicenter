/**
 * Where an authorization returns, on each build.
 *
 * The web build returns by navigation: the tab leaves for Google and Google
 * brings it back to `CALLBACK_PATH`, still holding the PKCE verifier in
 * `sessionStorage`. One path is enough there.
 *
 * The desktop build cannot. Google refuses a custom URI scheme for a Desktop
 * OAuth client and admits only a loopback redirect, and an Epicenter app window
 * admits navigation only to the host's own origin, so the consent screen opens
 * in the person's browser and Google answers on the host's socket rather than
 * in the WebView that left. `PENDING_CALLBACK_PATH` is how the WebView gets
 * that answer back, and it exists only because those two refusals meet.
 *
 * Both ends read these, which is why they are here rather than spelled once in
 * the host's route table and once in the page.
 *
 * Neither path carries a credential. The host holds an opaque URL for one
 * collection and reads nothing out of it; the code is redeemed in the window
 * that holds the verifier, and the refresh token goes straight to
 * `appStorage.secrets` from there (ADR-0310).
