/**
 * A mirror is a deterministic, disposable SQLite materialization of an
 * application-owned declaration. Its fingerprint names the current artifact:
 * `<name>.<fingerprint>.db`. A declaration edit is not an event the opener
 * handles, it is a different filename, so opening never drops, truncates,
 * migrates, or unlinks anything. See ADR-0194.
 *
 *     const mirror = defineMirror({ name: 'mail', declaration });
 *     const site = mirror.at(accountDir);
 *     site.open();               // writable, created if absent
 *     site.openReadonly();       // read-only, `null` when absent
 *     site.artifacts();          // what exists here, and which one is current
 *     site.reclaim(fingerprint); // delete one non-current artifact + sidecars
 *
 * `name` and `declaration` are the only inputs: no realm, domain, authority
 * identifier, filename override, or path template. The caller picks the
 * directory by passing it to `at()`, which is where per-tenant naming lives.
 *
 * This module owns canonical declaration hashing, the filename grammar, path
 * construction, artifact inspection, the two opening modes, and grammar-scoped
 * deletion. It owns nothing else: DDL, ingestion, cursors, "is the replacement
 * usable yet", locking, file permissions, and cleanup timing all stay with the
 * application. It deliberately imports nothing from this app.
 *
 * Duplicated byte-for-byte from `apps/local-books/src/mirror.ts`, deliberately
 * and temporarily. ADR-0194 set the bar for extracting this into a package as
 * "both apps adopt it without either pushing a knob into it"; Local Mail is the
 * second adopter, and it needed no knob (its `0700`/`0600` discipline and its
 * `lock.db` sibling stay in the app, exactly as the record predicted). So the
 * bar is now met and extraction is the next wave's work, not this one's. Until
 * then a copy beats a cross-app source import: both apps ship as standalone
 * `bun build --compile` binaries, and neither may reach into the other's tree.
 * Edit both or extract; do not let them diverge.
