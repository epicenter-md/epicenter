/**
 * The outbox: what this machine still owes Gmail, and what happened the last
 * time it tried to deliver it (ADR-0327).
 *
 * **Two owners, one view.** The intent store owns owed work: a row exists
 * because a person acted, and it leaves only when Gmail agrees or the person
 * abandons it (ADR-0199). This module owns the other half, which is what the
 * attempt said: `last_pass` holds one row per account, and that row is
 * overwritten by every pass. The outbox is the projection of the two, and it is
 * durable all the way down: everything here answers the same after a reload as
 * before one. Whether a pass is running this second is a fact about the surface
 * running it, so the surface says that beside this rather than through it.
 *
 * Keeping them apart is what stops the same fact being stored twice. "Three
 * changes waiting" is counted from the intent store at read time and is never
 * written down, so a pass that crashes between delivering and recording cannot
 * leave a stale number on screen; the worst it leaves is a stale explanation
 * beside a count that is already right.
 *
 * **One row per account, not a log.** A pass outcome answers "can my triage
 * reach Gmail right now", and only the latest answer can. A log would need a
 * retention rule, a reader, and an interface, and nothing has asked for one;
 * this is the same objection that kept a dead-letter table out of delivery,
 * applied to the record that replaced it.
 *
 * **Which is why an individually refused assertion is written here after all.**
 * `discarded` used to ride out on the pass's return value and be announced in a
 * toast, which was honest while the window ran the pass and stops being honest
 * once the host does (ADR-0323). It is stored as part of the last pass rather
 * than as rows of its own, so it inherits that row's lifetime: the next pass
 * replaces it, and nothing accumulates.
