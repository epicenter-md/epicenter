/**
 * The `/api` surface of `local-mail app`, as a Hono app. It owns routing, the
 * bearer gate, and request validation; the loopback host primitive around it
 * (`Bun.serve` in `app.ts`) owns the Host-check kill switch and static SPA
 * serving: `/api/*` falls through to this Hono app, `/*` serves `ui/dist`.
 *
 * The app is built by a factory so its per-launch dependencies (each account's
 * session and reconcile gate, the per-launch bearer) are injected rather than
 * captured at module load, while `export type ApiApp = ReturnType<typeof
 * createApiApp>` still hands the SPA a precise end-to-end typed `hc` client.
 * Every handler returns `c.json(...)`, so the client's response types are
 * inferred from the exact shapes the server returns: the wire contract cannot
 * silently drift.
 *
 * The surface is multi-account. `GET /api/accounts` lists the accounts the host
 * loaded at launch, and every read/write route is scoped under
 * `/api/accounts/:account/*`: one loopback origin serves all connected mailboxes
 * (`app.ts` holds one session, one gate, and one reconcile-owner lock attempt
 * for each). An unknown `:account` is a 404 (`AccountNotFound`); the set is
 * frozen at launch, matching the MCP one-session-per-account rule.
 *
 * Auth is one per-launch bearer, minted by the host and handed to the SPA out of
 * band (an injected `window.__LOCAL_MAIL__` global, never the URL). Every `/api`
 * request must present it; there is no bootstrap-token exchange endpoint.
 *
 * No route here writes to Gmail (ADR-0199). Every triage act, archive, read,
 * star, label, and trash alike, desugars into one `POST /messages/assert` that
 * records a durable local assertion and asks the host's reconciler to wake; the
 * reconciler delivers it (`POST /reconcile` is the explicit, synchronous form of
 * the same pass). Reads answer from the mirror WITH those assertions overlaid,
 * so the list a caller gets back already reflects the act it just made.
