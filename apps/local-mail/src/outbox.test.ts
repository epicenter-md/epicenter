/**
 * The outbox is durable state, so these tests are mostly about what survives.
 *
 * A pass writes what it did and then the surface that ran it goes away. Every
 * test below models that literally: the record is written through one set of
 * handles and read back through a second set over the same database, which is
 * exactly what a window closing and reopening is (ADR-0327). A test that read
 * back through the same handle would pass over an in-memory cache and prove
 * nothing.
 *
 * The other half is the projection: which of the four things a person can be
 * told follows from a count and a last pass. Those are the cases where a wrong
 * answer is silent, so they are enumerated rather than sampled.
