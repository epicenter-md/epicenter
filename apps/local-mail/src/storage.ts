/**
 * Local Mail's storage, which is two kinds of file and one keychain entry.
 *
 * | | what it is | where it lives |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | which accounts are connected | this device's own fact | `local`, durable |
 * | what this machine still owes Gmail | a person's own act | `local`, durable |
 * | what happened last time it was delivered | this device's own record | `local`, durable |
 * | the mail itself | borrowed data | `mail-<sub>`, one per account |
 *
 * **Nothing here is AppStorage Data.** Run ADR-0318's test on each artifact and
 * it answers no four times: Gmail is the authority for the copy, undelivered
 * triage is a command addressed to Gmail, the credential is Google's and lives
 * in the keychain, and which accounts are connected is a fact about this device
 * because the credential that makes a connection real cannot leave it
 * (ADR-0319). A preference would be the first artifact to answer yes, and there
 * is not one yet.
 *
 * **The split is by lifetime, not by concern.** `local` holds the only
 * irreplaceable bytes and is never unlinked; a mail file is a copy Gmail still
 * has and is unlinked whenever it is easier than repairing it. Putting them in
 * one file would give the account registry and a person's undelivered triage
 * the same corruption fate and the same backup size as gigabytes of cached
 * mail, and would buy no atomicity, because the write path never crosses them:
 * the effective-label overlay is applied at read time.
 *
 * **Nothing is mirrored to `~/AppStorage`.** That folder is how a person opens
 * their own data as files, and none of this is theirs to export: the mail copy
 * is Gmail's, and ADR-0306 refuses backup and export for a provider copy. The
 * two folder names this module used to claim were also keyed by a data id that
 * no longer exists, since Local Mail holds no AppStorage Data.
 *
 * **The partition key is the Google subject.** Reconnecting an account lands on
 * its own rows by arithmetic rather than by lookup, so no id is allocated and
 * none can be allocated twice.
