/**
 * The per-account reconcile-owner lock. The runtime invariant is: at most one
 * active reconciler per account, and the reconciler is the only thing that
 * writes to Gmail (ADR-0199), so this lock names the account's single writer
 * rather than just its single puller. Reads (`query`/`status`) open the mirror
 * read-only and triage acts only write the local intent store, so neither needs
 * it. The holders are the open desktop `app` (holds it for its whole lifetime
 * while its loop runs), a CLI `reconcile --watch` loop, and a one-shot act or
 * `reconcile` for the duration of its single pass.
 *
 * A dedicated `lock.db` held with `BEGIN EXCLUSIVE` is the lock: a second holder
 * fails to open the transaction instantly (`busy_timeout = 0`) and yields rather
 * than racing a second bulk pull. `flock` has no Bun API and an `O_EXCL` lockfile
 * is stale-on-crash; the fcntl lock a live SQLite transaction holds is released
 * by the kernel on `kill -9`, so a crashed owner never wedges the next pass.
 * SQLite tracks open connections per process, so this also refuses a second
 * in-process holder, not just a second process.
