/**
 * `local-mail app`: the desktop runtime host. One Bun process serves the triage
 * SPA and its `/api` over `127.0.0.1`, and the same process runs each account's
 * reconciler, holding the per-account lock for its lifetime (the single writer).
 * This is a loopback web host; the Tauri desktop shell points a
 * `WebviewUrl::External` window at this origin and owns nothing else. The bearer
 * stays injected into the HTML this engine serves and never transits Rust
 * (ADR-0116).
 *
 * The security model, condensed:
 *
 * - Every request is Host-checked first (the DNS-rebinding kill switch): a
 *   request whose Host is not exactly `127.0.0.1:<port>` is rejected before
 *   routing.
 * - The web UI authenticates with a per-launch local API bearer (a loopback
 *   credential, never a Gmail token). The host mints it and hands it to the SPA
 *   by injecting `window.__LOCAL_MAIL__ = { origin, bearer }` into the served
 *   HTML before the SPA's scripts run. No URL fragment, no exchange endpoint, no
 *   sessionStorage. Every `/api` call carries the bearer.
 * - HTML that carries the bearer is served `no-store` (a rotated bearer is never
 *   read from cache) and frame-denied (`frame-ancestors 'none'` +
 *   `X-Frame-Options: DENY`), so a cross-origin page cannot frame the
 *   auto-authenticated SPA and clickjack a triage write.
 * - While running, the host writes a `0600` presence file (`runtime.json`:
 *   `{ origin, bearer, pid }`) so a same-UID out-of-process reader can find this
 *   bearer. Today that reader is the Vite dev server, whose proxy injects the
 *   bearer on each proxied `/api` request (SvelteKit's dev HTML pipeline cannot
 *   reproduce the prod HTML injection). Presence, not discovery-for-spawn:
 *   nothing starts the host from it.
 *
 * Routing, the bearer gate, and request validation live in the Hono app
 * (`http/api.ts`); this module owns the loopback host primitive, static SPA
 * serving with bearer injection, and the process lifecycle, dispatching
 * `/api/*` to `api.fetch`.
