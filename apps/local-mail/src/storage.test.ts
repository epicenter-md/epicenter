/**
 * How each of Local Mail's two kinds of file is opened, which is the only code
 * here that destroys data.
 *
 * The durable file is migrated and never unlinked, and it refuses a shape from
 * the future rather than writing through it. A borrowed file is demolished
 * whenever its shape is not the one this build understands, in either
 * direction, because Gmail still has the originals (ADR-0319). Those two
 * sentences are opposite policies applied by one module, so the tests that
 * matter are the ones that prove the policies cannot be swapped.
