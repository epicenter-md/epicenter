/**
 * The act path: what happens the moment a human (or an agent) triages a
 * message. It is entirely local. Archive, mark read, star, apply a label, and
 * move to trash all desugar to the same thing here, a per-message label
 * assertion recorded in the durable intent store (ADR-0198), and nothing on this
 * path touches Gmail. `reconcile.ts` is the only Gmail writer, and it runs
 * later (ADR-0199).
 *
 * Two rules give the surfaces their behaviour for free:
 *
 * - Labels resolve to Gmail label ids HERE, because a name is a display string
 *   the user can rename while an assertion waits; what is stored is the
 *   immutable id. Gmail's SYSTEM ids are protocol constants and resolve without
 *   the mirror, so archive, read, star, and trash keep working before the first
 *   pull and across a mirror rebuild. Only custom labels are mailbox data, and
 *   only they are looked up.
 * - EVERY valid opinion is recorded, at a fresh sequence, even when the mirror
 *   already agrees with it. Nothing here reads Gmail's facts to decide whether
 *   an act is worth keeping, and nothing here deletes an assertion.
 *
 * That second rule is the one worth defending, because skipping or cancelling
 * on mirror agreement looks free and is not. The mirror lags: it does not carry
 * a change the reconciler has sent but not yet pulled back, and it can be stale
 * against Gmail for a whole poll interval. An act judged redundant against those
 * facts is a user choice dropped silently. So undo before delivery REPLACES the
 * pending assertion (a fresh sequence, which also invalidates the retirement of
 * the delivery it raced) rather than erasing it, and the worst case is one
 * redundant label modify, which Gmail accepts as a no-op. A wasted request is a
 * bounded, visible cost; a lost intent is neither.
 *
 * Ids are snapshotted by the caller, not resolved later: the surfaces pass the
 * concrete message ids the user acted on, so a message that arrives into the
 * same thread or view afterwards is untouched.
 */

/** The cap on how many messages one act covers. Deliberately not Gmail's
 * per-request limit: nothing here is a request. It exists so a mistyped bulk act
 * cannot record an unbounded drain, and it is refused with the count rather than

 * ids in `addLabelIds` and 100 in `removeLabelIds` (Gmail API reference,
 * verified 2026-08-01). Enforced here, in the core rather than only in the MCP
 * tool schema, so no surface can record an act whose shape Gmail would refuse.
 *
 * Scope, precisely: this bounds ONE act, not the total pending for a message.
 * Two acts of 60 labels each leave 120 pending for the same message, and the
 * drain groups them into one request Gmail will refuse. That case is handled
 * where it happens rather than pre-empted here: a refused group is retried one
 * assertion at a time, so every one of them still lands (see `reconcile.ts`).
 * The cost is one wasted request in a case that needs an account with a hundred
 * custom labels to reach at all.
