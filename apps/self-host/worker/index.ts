/**
 * Epicenter self-hosted instance Worker (Cloudflare; ADR-0075).
 *
 * The instance on Cloudflare: the same `@epicenter/server` surfaces the Bun entry
 * (`server.ts`) builds, wired to Cloudflare bindings instead of plain
 * primitives (ADR-0066), minus attach. Attach is the one surface the two runtimes
 * do not share: its transport is `Bun.serve`'s WebSocket handler and its
 * per-device grants are an in-process store, neither of which survives a Worker
 * isolate, so `createAttachRelayBunServer`, `createDeviceGrantStore`,
 * `mountAttachGrantsApp`, and `mountHostDirectoryApp` ship only in the `/bun`
 * barrel. Run the Bun entry if you want remote Super Chat attach on your
 * instance. `runtime-profile.test.ts` declares that divergence and holds every
 * other surface to parity across both entries.
 * One single-partition instance, not a multi-user wiki and not
 * a mode: every request resolves to the pinned `principals/instance` partition,
 * and authentication is one operator-supplied static
 * bearer (`INSTANCE_TOKEN`), constant-time compared. No OAuth, no allowlist, no
 * sessions. "Solo" vs "shared" is only how many people hold the token.
 *
 * This is a reference, not an Epicenter-operated product. Copy this folder, set
 * `INSTANCE_TOKEN` (`wrangler secret put INSTANCE_TOKEN`, generated with
 * `bun run gen-token`), provision your Durable Object binding, and deploy. The
 * instance composes no Better Auth and no Postgres, so there is no Hyperdrive
 * binding and no `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (ADR-0075). Community-supported.
 *
 * Trust boundary: the deployer operates the infrastructure. Epicenter never holds
 * or sees the data stored here, so self-hosting is functionally zero-knowledge
 * against Epicenter.

// each request (ADR-0066). `assertStrongToken` runs the SAME entropy gate the Bun
// entry runs at boot, so a missing or weak token fails closed on Cloudflare too
// (ADR-0075's entropy floor): a Worker has no boot phase, so the gate runs per
// request and a throw surfaces as a 500 instead of admitting a weak credential. It
// also returns the trimmed token, so there is no `?? ''` coalesce whose removal
// could silently let an unset secret reach the compare.
