# Epicenter API (Hosted Personal Cloud)

Epicenter Cloud Worker. Handles authentication, real-time sync, AI inference, and billing for the hosted personal cloud product. Cloud composes `@epicenter/server` by resolving Better Auth users as principals.

This folder is a single Cloudflare Worker deployment: `worker/` (Hono code) and `ui/` (SvelteKit dashboard SPA) ship together. The self-hosted single-partition instance lives in the sibling `apps/self-host`; it resolves one operator bearer to the literal `instance` principal, has no billing surface, and (because it composes no Better Auth) no Postgres either (ADR-0075, ADR-0076).

Part of the [Epicenter](https://github.com/EpicenterHQ/epicenter) monorepo. AGPL-3.0 licensed. If you host a modified version, you share your changes. See `apps/self-host` for the self-hosted reference and the trust model below.

Runs on Cloudflare Workers with Durable Objects. Store sync is one WebSocket
route, `/api/store/v1/sync`, mounted by `mountStoreSyncApp`
(`packages/server/src/store-sync/`). It resolves one Durable Object per
(principal, application id, generation), named
`principals/<principalId>/data/<dataId>/generations/<generation>`, holding an
opaque positional log (ADR-0292, ADR-0298).

The principal is stamped from the resolved bearer and the Durable Object is
addressed by it, so a client supplies a workspace id and a cursor and nothing
else. There is no catalog, grant table, or authorization lookup, and no value a
client can put in the query that reaches another partition: the isolation is
structural rather than checked. **Being signed in on two devices is the whole of
the sharing model.** Both devices resolve to one principal, address one
authority, and converge; nothing is paired, invited, or approved.

The authority reads nothing it stores (ADR-0298). It holds opaque bytes, hands
them back in order, and imports neither Yjs nor a workspace.

## Why a hub exists

Local-first doesn't mean no server. It means your data lives on your machine and you aren't dependent on a cloud service to function. But some operations genuinely need a single authority: user identity, API key storage, AI proxying. Trying to make every device a peer for these operations led to three failed attempts at distributed key management before we split into hub (central authority) and local (device-side execution).

The hub handles auth, sync relay, and AI. Local servers handle filesystem access, offline editing, and low-latency operations. Neither tries to do the other's job. See [Why Epicenter Split Into Hub and Local Servers](/docs/articles/why-epicenter-split-into-hub-and-local-servers.md) for the full story.

## Stack and priorities

Hono handles HTTP routing. We originally wanted Elysia: it's faster, the API is more ergonomic, and it runs natively on Bun. But Elysia depends on Bun-specific APIs that don't exist in the Cloudflare Workers runtime, and Workers compatibility was non-negotiable. Hono runs on Cloudflare Workers, Node.js, Deno, Bun, and AWS Lambda, so when the server moved to a second runtime (ADR-0066), the route layer came along for free.

Cloudflare Durable Objects are the hosted deployment target. Three things make them a natural fit for a store authority:

- **Single-threaded per object.** Each authority runs in its own isolate. No mutex, no race conditions on the log. The runtime guarantees it.
- **Built-in SQLite.** The update log lives inside the Durable Object's storage. No external database for sync state, no connection pooling, no cold-start latency from network hops.
- **WebSocket Hibernation.** Idle connections don't consume compute. A user can leave a tab open for hours and the object sleeps until the next message arrives. Costs stay proportional to actual sync traffic, not connection count. A woken object rebuilds each socket's position from the attachment the socket carries.

`StoreAuthority` (`packages/server/src/store-sync/authority.ts`) is a thin
adapter and nothing more. Every rule about who has been sent what lives in
`@epicenter/data/sync`, so what is deployed here and what the transport's tests
drive are the same object rather than two that agree today. Routes, auth, AI,
and validation are plain runtime-portable Hono.

`apps/self-host` is the sibling deployable: the single-partition instance, a Bun
binary or a Cloudflare Worker that composes no Better Auth and no Postgres
(ADR-0075, ADR-0076), so the whole box is one bearer token. It is
community-supported, not Epicenter-operated, and it does not mount store sync
today. `apps/api/server.ts` here is this hosted cloud on Bun (local dev and the
runtime-parity smoke), booting the same composition against plain Postgres and
any S3 endpoint with no Cloudflare account. The surfaces that need Worker-only
bindings are absent there: store sync and attach ride Durable Objects, the
dashboard shell comes from `ASSETS`, and billing needs the Autumn secret and the
after-response drain. `runtime-profile.test.ts` is where that divergence is
declared and checked against both entries.

Better Auth handles identity. Hosted Epicenter requires Google, GitHub, and Microsoft social sign-in (email/password is disabled in `base-config.ts`), plus an OAuth provider plugin that turns the hub into a standards-compliant OAuth server. Desktop and mobile clients authenticate via OAuth/PKCE flows, get a token, and use it for all subsequent API calls and WebSocket connections.

## Trust model

Epicenter Cloud is operated by Epicenter, so Epicenter infrastructure is inside
the trust boundary for hosted data. `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` signs auth cookies,
tokens, and OAuth state; it is not a data encryption root.

Self-hosted deployments move the trust boundary to infrastructure the deployer
operates. Epicenter never holds or sees data stored in a self-hosted deployment,
so self-hosting is functionally zero-knowledge against Epicenter.

That confidentiality covers content, not the wire, and it does not erase three
things a self-hoster should weigh. The operator still sees the metadata around
the bytes (principal id, application id, message timing, size, and IP);
that operator is Epicenter when hosted and you when self-hosted, and even a
future blind server keeps seeing this envelope. Blobs land wherever
`BLOBS_S3_ENDPOINT` points, so renting Epicenter's blob service puts your media
in Epicenter's R2 even on a self-hosted instance; point the store at your own S3
to keep media local. And hosted sign-in leans on social OAuth (email/password is
disabled in `base-config.ts`); a self-hosted instance uses one operator-supplied
bearer instead and registers no OAuth app at all (ADR-0071, ADR-0075). The full
ledger, with the reasoning, is in [docs/trust-model.md](/docs/trust-model.md).

### Why not zero-knowledge?

Zero-knowledge means the server can't read your data. The cost: account recovery doesn't work (the server can't re-derive your key, so a lost key is lost data), search doesn't work (the server can't index ciphertext), AI doesn't work (the server can't read your notes to summarize them), and moving to a new device means transferring the key by hand.

PGP has been trying to make key management practical for thirty years. Signal works because messaging is one-dimensional. The server is a relay that never processes content. Most apps aren't relays. Epicenter needs to search documents, run AI against notes, and let users recover a lost account without losing everything. The relay reads plaintext, which is what makes those features possible; if you want a server that can't read your data, self-host it.

For the full argument:

- [If You Don't Trust the Server, Become the Server](/docs/articles/if-you-dont-trust-the-server-become-the-server.md): self-hosting as the clean answer

API keys for AI providers are environment secrets (`wrangler secret put`). They never leave the hub. The client sends a session token, the hub validates it and swaps in the real key before forwarding to the provider.

## Development

Prerequisites: Bun, local PostgreSQL, and Infisical CLI authentication
(`infisical login`). `bun run dev` pipes secrets from Infisical's dev
environment into Wrangler via `process.env`, so Postgres alone is not enough.
This package owns the hosted API `.infisical.json`; account-wide operator
commands live in `ops`. The monorepo root intentionally has no Infisical config.

### Local Postgres setup

The API needs a local PostgreSQL instance for development. The connection string is configured in `wrangler.jsonc` under the Hyperdrive `localConnectionString`.

```bash
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql

# Homebrew creates a role matching your macOS username. Create the postgres role and database:
psql -d postgres -c "CREATE ROLE postgres WITH LOGIN SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'postgres';"
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE epicenter;"

# Push the schema
bun run db:push:local
```

### How database URLs work

There are three layers, each with a different URL source:

| Layer | Source | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| Local dev (runtime) | `wrangler.jsonc` Hyperdrive `localConnectionString` | `bun dev` (wrangler) |
| Local dev (drizzle-kit) | `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL` parsed from `wrangler.jsonc` | `db:push:local`, `db:studio:local` |
| Remote admin | `DATABASE_URL` injected by `infisical run` | `db:migrate:remote`, `db:studio:remote` |

`bun run dev` runs `infisical run -- wrangler dev` with a local-only `--var` override for `API_PUBLIC_ORIGIN`. Wrangler reads required auth bindings from the spawned process via the `secrets.required` config, including `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, so local OAuth uses the Google client stored in Infisical's dev environment. No `.dev.vars` file is produced. Remote database commands use `infisical run` against the prod environment and should be treated as admin operations, not dev mode.

### Running the server

```bash
bun dev              # Local dev server (uses local Postgres)
bun run smoke:local  # Runtime-parity smoke with dev auth and fake local env
bun deploy           # Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
bun run typecheck    # Type check
bun test             # Run tests
```

`smoke:local` is the no-Infisical verification path. It starts `server.dev.ts`,
runs `apps/api/scripts/smoke.ts`, keeps its server log and data directory under a
temporary directory, and skips the blob leg unless `BLOBS_S3_*` points at a
local S3-compatible store.

### Local blob storage

Blob storage is optional: omit `BLOBS_S3_*` and the blob routes answer `503
StorageNotConfigured` while everything else runs. To exercise blobs locally, run
a real S3-compatible store alongside the server. `compose.yaml` starts
[versitygw](https://github.com/versity/versitygw) (an S3 API over a plain folder)
and creates the `epicenter-blobs` bucket:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Then set the `BLOBS_S3_*` values from `.env.example` (endpoint
`http://localhost:7070`). Your blobs land as ordinary files under
`.data/blobs/epicenter-blobs/`.

Browser replicas upload and download through short-lived presigned object-store
URLs. The bucket CORS policy must allow each trusted application origin to use
`GET` and `PUT`, and must allow the `Content-Type` and `If-None-Match` request
headers. This is deployment configuration, not Worker CORS: a missing
`If-None-Match` allowance makes immutable browser uploads fail at preflight.

The server runs the same portable S3 client against versitygw, Garage, AWS S3, or
R2; the store is endpoint-as-config, so swapping it is a config change, never a
code change. There is no filesystem blob backend in the codebase by design: the
self-host story is "run the server next to an S3-compatible service," exactly as
the hosted Worker runs next to R2. `apps/api/scripts/smoke.ts` exercises the full
blob round-trip against whichever store the server points at.

### Database commands

```bash
bun run auth:generate:remote # Generate Better Auth schema
bun run db:generate      # Generate Drizzle migrations
bun run db:push:local     # Push schema to local Postgres (dev only, use migrations for remote)
bun run db:migrate:remote # Run migrations against remote (via Infisical)
bun run db:studio:local  # Open Drizzle Studio (local)
bun run db:studio:remote # Open Drizzle Studio (remote, via Infisical)
```
