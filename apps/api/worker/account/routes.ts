/**
 * Hosted account deletion: `DELETE /api/account`.
 *
 * The route owns HTTP shape and wiring; `service.ts` owns the retry-safe
 * step order. A partial failure answers 503 with the failed step; deletion is
 * complete only when the route answers 204.
 *
 * Authentication is deliberately narrower than the other principal surfaces:
 * a FRESH host-only session cookie, read with the cookie cache disabled. A
 * bearer cannot trigger deletion (a leaked token must not be able to destroy
 * the account), a stale session is refused with the same `SESSION_NOT_FRESH`
 * remedy the dashboard already handles, and the cache bypass means this route
 * always observes the live session row.
 *
 * After the gated steps succeed, the authority and blob sweeps run once more:
 * while the auth user still existed, a signed-in device could re-register
 * workspace state or land a blob, so one post-fence pass sweeps that window.
 * Sweep failures are logged, not surfaced: the auth user is gone, no retry
 * can authenticate, and the residue is unreachable garbage, not user data.
 *
 * Known non-atomic residue, accepted and documented: a presigned blob PUT
 * issued up to five minutes earlier can land after the final sweep; other
 * cookie surfaces may honor the deleting browser's cached session for up to
 * five minutes after 204; an Autumn customer deleted out-of-band leaves any
 * Stripe counterpart to manual reconciliation (the 404 tolerance cannot see
 * Stripe).
 *
 * Lives in apps/api, not @epicenter/server: Better Auth, Postgres, and Autumn
 * are hosted-only deployment policy. The self-hosted instance has no per-user
 * account; its analog would be an operator-owned whole-instance reset, which
 * deliberately does not exist as an HTTP surface.
