/**
 * The hosted account-deletion coordinator: retry-safe ordering with no
 * cross-system transaction. Every step is idempotent and they run in an
 * order that keeps a retry authenticated:
 *
 *   (There is no store step. See `routes.ts`.)
 *   1. blobs          removed-was-authority: the account Durable Object (
 *                     sockets) — never refused by allowance or the wall
 *   2. blobs          the `principals/<id>/blobs/` object prefix
 *   3. billing        the Autumn customer and its Stripe counterpart
 *   4. observations   hosted storage-observation rows (no FK, never cascade)
 *   5. auth user      the Better Auth user row; sessions, provider accounts,
 *                     OAuth tokens, consents, and passkeys cascade from it
 *
 * The auth user goes LAST: it is the durable gate against any later
 * authenticated operation, and while it survives, a client can retry the
 * whole request after a partial failure. Deletion is complete only when the
 * route answers 204.
