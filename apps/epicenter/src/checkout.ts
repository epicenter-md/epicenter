/**
 * The host's half of the `~/Epicenter` working copy (ADR-0337).
 *
 * The application renders, diffs, and decides. This writes the files it is
 * handed and reads back the files it holds, and interprets neither: nothing
 * here parses frontmatter, opens a store, decodes a CRDT update, or holds a
 * definition.
 *
 * ADR-0271 refused a host that reads the folder at all. That refusal served
 * the one-way rule and goes with it; what stays refused is a host that
 * INTERPRETS a file, which is a narrower promise and the one worth keeping.
 *
 * What this module owes.
 *
 * **A path cannot escape the folder.** Checked twice, because the two checks
 * promise different things. Containment is the host's own promise about its
 * own root and holds whatever the application sends. The file grammar is the
 * application's shape, and refusing anything else is what keeps the folder to
 * what a checkout produces.
 *
 * **A file is never half-written.** Something else reads this folder, and an
 * agent that reads a note mid-write sees a truncated one. Every write lands in
 * a temporary file and is renamed into place, which is atomic within a
 * filesystem.
 *
 * **A checkout that stops halfway reads as dirty, not as clean.** The manifest
 * is written last, so an interrupted pull leaves the previous one describing a
 * folder that no longer matches it, and the next pull says so.
 *
 * **What a checkout does not name is not the host's to keep.** A checkout is
 * complete by definition, so a file the application did not send no longer
 * exists. That is filtered to the four shapes a checkout produces, which
 * includes the `AGENTS.md` it generates; a person's own `README.md` and the
 * `drafts/` they keep are not among them and are never written, read back, or
 * removed here.
 *
 * **One request at a time, per folder.** A read and a write are chained on the
 * same promise, so a `GET` never catches a folder half-replaced and two writes
 * never interleave their sweeps. It is a chain in this process rather than a
 * lock on disk: the host is the one process that owns `~/Epicenter`
 * (`tauri-plugin-single-instance`), so a lock file bought exclusion against
 * nobody and could outlive the process that took it.
 *
 * **A write says which folder it was written against.** A read hands back a
 * digest of the bytes it produced, a write requires it back, and the compare
 * happens in the same chain slot as the sweep. That is what makes the approval
 * a person gave describe the folder the write lands on, and it is still bytes:
 * nothing here reads what the digest is a digest of.
