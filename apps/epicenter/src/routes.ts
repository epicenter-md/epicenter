 * no per-file path to route, capture, or validate. That is what the earlier
 * per-file design cost, and it cost it silently: Hono routes a bare `*` but
 * captures nothing under it, so every write arrived with an empty path.
 *
 * The `folder` segment this route used to carry named `local` or `account`,
 * and went with the device store: there is one store per data id (ADR-0336),
 * so there is one folder.
 *
 * The host takes the data id from the caller and does not verify that the
 * caller owns it, which is the trust model rather than a gap in it: a deployed
 * app is a trusted app (ADR-0334), and ADR-0118 decided that every SPA on this
 * origin is fully trusted. Do not add a per-app credential to close this. The
 * thing that would change it is an origin per app, so that the socket answers
 * who is asking and the id leaves the URL entirely.
