/**
 * Fail when a retired word reappears in the store's vocabulary (ADR-0309).
 *
 * A field holds a **value**, replaced whole, or a **node**, edited in place.
 * `scalar` and `prose` were the old names and both were wrong: `tags` is an
 * array and behaves exactly like `title`, and a node holds whatever its table's
 * codec says, which `packages/chat` proves is often not writing at all.
 *
 * The reason this is a script and not a note in a style guide is that ADR-0244
 * settled the same kind of question, shipped no check, and needed a hand-run
 * campaign afterwards. A word that nothing enforces drifts back one comment at a
 * time. This also catches more than vocabulary: a retired word marks text
 * written before a design changed, so the sweep that introduced this file found
 * three documents describing subsystems that had already been deleted.
 *
 * Two rules, scoped differently, because the two words are not alike.
 *
 * `scalar` has no ordinary meaning here, so it is checked almost everywhere. It
 * survives in three kinds of place, all excluded by subsystem: Matter keeps its
 * own copy of the field palette and its own words, `local-books` and
 * `local-mail` genuinely lift scalar columns into SQLite mirrors of their own,
 * and YAML calls a plain node a scalar.
 *
 * `prose` is an ordinary English word, so checking it everywhere would flag the
 * writing skills on every line. It is checked only where the store's vocabulary
 * lives, which `PROSE_SCOPE` lists. That list is the honest statement of the
 * rule's reach; adding a place to it is how the rule grows.
 *
 * `column` is NOT checked. ADR-0269 deleted the SQL projection, so the store has
 * no columns, but Drizzle schemas, table UI, the append-only log's one real
 * SQLite column, and two app-owned mirrors all have real ones. A ban would be
 * mostly exceptions, and an exception list is the thing that rots.
 *
 * For a legitimate use inside a scanned file, put a marker on the line above:
 *   `// vocab-check: ignore-next-line (reason)` in TypeScript and Svelte
 *   `<!-- vocab-check: ignore-next-line (reason) -->` in Markdown
 * or `vocab-check: ignore-file` anywhere in a file that is entirely about the
 * old world.
