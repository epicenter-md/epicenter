/**
 * Measurement-method validation. Fail-closed by construction.
 *
 * Policy (ADR-0161; spec 424-444, 555-562): evidence never selects, ranks,
 * recommends, applies a tie-break, or returns a candidate id. There is no
 * recommendation, winner, or tie-break concept anywhere in this module.
 * `validateMethod` gives a run its method-validation verdict: whether every
 *    measurement-method proof gate, DERIVED FROM RECORDED OPERATIONS by the
 *    runner, passed. A gate is never a hardcoded boolean; the runner must feed
 *    evidence it actually executed and retained. A pilot validates the METHOD
 *    only; it is never ADR-ready.
 *
 * Final-evidence readiness and absolute SLO policy are deliberately absent. No
 * product policy owns those concepts yet, so this pilot reports only the method
 * facts it can establish and never predicts a future ADR-readiness contract.
 *
 * Correctness note (spec/audit): a candidate reproducing the analytical, V1-bound
 * oracle witness is the INDEPENDENT correctness proof. When every candidate
 * reproduces that witness, mutual consistency follows by equality and does not
 * earn a duplicate gate. Reopen consistency remains a separate observation.
