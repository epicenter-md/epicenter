# scalar-facts-layout

A measurement-method instrument for one narrow question in Wave 2b: how should
the scalar state tables of the local replica and the server authority store their
structured coordinates and relation split? It is intended to measure Bun
`bun:sqlite` at the conformance envelope. The current executable validates only
the bounded method wiring described below.

## Evidence and decision separation (read first)

Per ADR-0161 and `specs/20260720T002337-epicenter-data-clean-break.md` (424-444,
555-562), **evidence never selects, ranks, recommends, applies a tie-break, or
returns a candidate id.** Nothing in this directory produces a winner. The
human ADR process, not this code, decides. Any future classifier, absolute SLO
policy, or final-evidence readiness contract needs its own product decision and
owner; none is predicted here.

Two consequences are enforced mechanically here:

- A **measurement-method pilot** validates the method. It is never
  decision-eligible and can never make evidence ADR-ready. Its only product is
  `methodValidated` plus explicit proof refusals (`evidence-status.ts`), and
  `methodValidated` is derived from RECORDED operations, never a hardcoded
  boolean.
- Final-evidence readiness and absolute performance SLO policy are absent. Their
  thresholds and state model are unmade ADR/product choices, so this pilot emits
  no guessed readiness status or placeholder policy.

## Executable status: a BOUNDED SMOKE, not yet the frozen pilot

`pilot.ts` `--profile smoke` (default) exercises the method wiring at bounded
scale but is **not** the frozen exact-envelope pilot and can **never** be
method-validated: the `exact-envelope` gate (exactly 1,000,000 present addresses,
512 MiB proxy, four seeds, three cycles) fails, and the `checkpoint-truthful`
gate fails because there is no truthful non-perturbing autocheckpoint boundary
signal yet (WAL shrink is not one; a measurement checkpoint would perturb the
workload). `--profile pilot` measures a bounded probe, extrapolates the disk and
wall-time to the exact envelope, enforces the eight-hour cap and headroom, and
refuses to run. The frozen pilot is not implemented to contract yet.

The pilot reports method validation, named proof refusals, and identity-closed
seed estimators. It does not estimate a winner or emit candidate ranking,
contrast, feasibility, SLO, or final-readiness output.

**Open contract gaps (not done), tracked for the next passes:**

- Faithful owner operations: `foldPointRead` must be an authority-fold read,
  cleanup must delete only document-owning rows, and settlement must consume real
  sealed V1 work and update retry/parked/settlement state.
- A truthful post-commit WAL-index checkpoint observation, or the pilot stays
  BLOCKED pending a native hook.
- Closed config/seed identities for every macro, tail, boundary, warmup batch,
  and checkpoint event. Database builds, calibration trials, and phase-disjoint
  calibration/warmup/timed probe plans are closed, and exact counts are derived,
  but the remaining event identities are not yet all first-class raw fields.
- An independent in-range oracle witness for the bounded traversal statement.
  The retained trace-derived traversal pages and page digests prove the intended
  phase identity and disjointness; the full scan proves candidate correctness,
  but neither witnesses what that separate candidate-store SQL path returned.
- A separately invocable, config-frozen, headroom/time-gated exact run distinct
  from `--estimate-only`, with the extrapolation validated at two bounded sizes.
- Frozen final-run config emission with disjoint final seed ids, only from a
  valid pilot.

**Method validation is not evidence readiness.** The pilot deliberately emits no
readiness status. Browser OPFS, Cloudflare Durable Object, full-envelope final
data, and selected absolute performance policy remain external requirements for
any later ADR-ready evidence contract.

## Modular pilot architecture

The modular exact-trace pilot is a set of cohesive, independently tested modules.
Bun owns only the local runner and SQLite lifecycle; trace generation, framing,
hashing, scheduling, and method validation are portable to browser runtimes.

- `portable-hash.ts`: a streaming SHA-256, byte-identical to the V1 kernel's
  `sha256Hex`, plus `utf8ByteLength`. Removes the Bun `CryptoHasher`/`Buffer`
  dependence so the workload hashes reproduce in a browser.
- `trace.ts`: the deterministic corpus, aging events, and the analytical oracle.
  Its `Fact`/`Address` types ARE the private V1 kernel types, and its byte oracle
  is the kernel encoder, so it cannot emit a fact the protocol would reject.
- `v1-binding.ts`: proves, against the real kernel `parseFact`/`encodedFactBytes`,
  that representative generated facts admit and that the trace byte oracle equals
  the kernel's. This binding is the **independent correctness proof**.
- `auxiliary-traces.ts`: owner-specific pending, sealed, parked, document, and
  retry traces, each deterministic, hashed, and bound to the V1 intent/submission/
  parked shapes. The coordinate-layout decision applies to every address-bearing
  owner table, so no universal owner claim is admissible without these.
- `schedule.ts`: the balanced Williams read schedule (three cycles, self-transition
  pairs, seed-rotated letter mapping, recorded idle+reopen boundaries) and the
  retained actual power-of-two calibration contract. Each operation-count round
  is one exact sixteen-trial Williams design. The first all-clear round selects;
  cap exhaustion retains a named `INCOMPLETE` artifact with no fallback count.
- `estimators.ts`: reduces each owner, metric family, candidate, seed, and config
  identity independently, and accepts persisted estimators only when they exactly
  match a fresh reduction of retained raw observations.
- `checkpoint.ts`: atomically persisted, schema-validated, cross-process
  per-seed checkpointing. Identity binds the exact source, whole config,
  per-seed trace inputs, per-candidate DDL hashes, limits digest, runtime and SQLite
  versions, execution settings, and workload and auxiliary digests; resume happens
  only at a committed whole-seed boundary and fails closed on any mismatch,
  truncation, or partial seed.
- `probe-plan.ts`: the layout-independent owner of deterministic probe sources.
  It derives exact indexed ranges, 48 non-empty traversal pages, trace-derived
  page digests, phase item digests, and final probe ids from frozen trace options.
  The runner and checkpoint validation both consume these reconstructed plans.
- `raw-schema.ts`: closed raw-observation shapes, exact gap-free temporal replay,
  config/seed/owner/candidate-bound build identities, and content-addressed probe
  plans compared field-for-field with the reconstructed deterministic owner.
  Calibration, warmup, and timed traversal use distinct sequence-bounded pages;
  the pilot does not claim candidate execution of those pages is independently
  witnessed yet.
- `layouts.ts`: the four SQLite candidate stores. Coordinates are an immutable
  append-only dictionary; normalized fact tables enforce coordinate kind and
  row_id shape; install is monotonic and tombstone-dominant; storage counts every
  candidate-owned btree including autoindexes. `layouts-invariants.test.ts` proves
  each with direct hostile SQL.
- `evidence-status.ts`: method validation and named proof refusals only.

## Correctness vs consistency

- **Independent correctness**: a candidate store reproduces the analytical,
  V1-bound oracle witness (exact current-fact count, exact current-protocol-fact
  bytes, and one ordered SHA-256 over the current facts). The oracle is a
  closed-form function of the trace, not a peer read path.
- **Consistency, not correctness**: candidates agreeing with one another, or a
  reopened database agreeing with itself, is cross-candidate / reopen consistency.
  It is a separate proof gate and never stands in for the oracle correctness proof.

## Two distinct byte measures (ADR-0161, ADR-0167)

The trace keeps present-logical-state bytes (the ADR-0167 proxy, the 512 MiB /
1,000,000-live-address target quantity) separate from current-protocol-fact bytes
(a storage and workload diagnostic over every current fact, including terminal
absences). `trace.calibration.traceAdmissible` is a narrow trace-construction
flag (the corpus hit its byte target and no fact exceeds the ceiling); it is not
an ADR/evidence-cell qualification and never implies a cell is decision-eligible.

## Determinism

Seeded PRNG only; no wall clock or `Math.random` in the workload.
Paired candidates within one seed see exactly the same trace; each seed is an
independent outer unit. Same seed and config reproduce byte-identical trace
identity, schedule, estimator inputs, and method gates.

## Historical monolith (`scalar-facts-layout.ts`): decision-disabled

The parent `scalar-facts-layout.ts` retains the first benchmark implementation and
its 2026-07-21 Bun/native full run. It is retained as **provisional evidence
only** and is **decision-disabled**: it issues no recommendation and its latency
estimator was found inadequate by two independent reviews. It predates and does
not use the modular exact trace.

Its storage numbers are **whole-database, post-phase-WAL page evidence**, not
candidate-table-only true filesystem peaks: they measure the entire database file
(including fixture tables and WAL state after a phase) rather than the isolated
candidate-varying tables' peak filesystem bytes. Treat the roughly 20% normalized
storage finding as directional whole-database evidence at this envelope, not a
frozen candidate-table peak.

### Legacy scope and refusals

The monolith compares the four relation and coordinate layouts only for the
confirmed-facts table. It exercises replica and authority workloads, but it does
not design or qualify pending intents, sealed submissions, parked diagnostics,
document publication, blob publication, blob bytes, or metadata. It therefore
cannot freeze a schema-wide coordinate representation or any non-facts layout.
The modular pilot closes more owner-specific traces, but it is still only a
method pilot and does not select a layout.

The retained artifact reports `legacy-bun-diagnostic` with
`decisionEligible: false`. It cannot qualify browser OPFS behavior, quota,
WebKit, worker locks, mobile memory and backgrounding, or Durable Object SQLite.
Its live schema is version 4; the historical schema-version-3 artifact under
`docs/benchmarks/scalar-facts-layout/` has an incompatible shape.

### Legacy profile is not a portability guarantee

The 1,000,000-live-address / 512 MiB target is a conditional normal profile only
where runtime quota admits it. The broader proof still needs these distinct
tiers:

- legacy smoke diagnostic: 5,000 current facts and approximately 1 MiB of
  initial payload;
- physical mobile floor: 250,000 live addresses and 128 MiB on physical iOS
  Safari and Android;
- conditional normal profile: 1,000,000 live addresses and 512 MiB where quota
  admits;
- informational desktop stress: 2,000,000 live addresses and 1 GiB;
- private or incognito mode: a negative persistence-refusal test, never a
  durable qualification cell.

The monolith's `initialPayloadBytes` sums payload strings while it installs the
initial facts. It is not ADR-0167 present-logical-state bytes and is not current
protocol-fact bytes. Aging later adds rewrites, tombstones, and unsets. Only the
modular trace owns those two exact byte measures.

### Legacy measurement and oracle limits

The monolith retains three diagnostics: initial payload bytes, steady physical
database pages after checkpoint and settle, and phase WAL file sizes. Phase WAL
sizes are bounded observations around named phases, not cumulative write
amplification. The report intentionally emits no logical-state amplification or
protocol-overhead ratio.

It retains every owner, candidate, repetition, metric, and storage observation,
checks matrix completeness and physical conformance, and reports no materiality
band, Pareto filter, ordering, fallback, or winner. Its semantic witness is
cross-candidate agreement over its own deterministic corpus. That is a
consistency check, not the modular trace's independent analytical oracle, and is
another reason the legacy diagnostic cannot become decision evidence.
