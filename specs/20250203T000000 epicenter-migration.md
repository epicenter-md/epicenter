# Epicenter Migration Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the migration from "Whispering" to "Epicenter" as the main project name, with a clear separation between the Epicenter ecosystem and the Whispering app.

## Current Structure
```

├── apps/
│   ├── app/         # Main Whispering desktop/web app
│   ├── sh/          # epicenter.sh web interface
│   ├── cli/         # Epicenter CLI
│   └── api/         # API service
├── packages/        # Shared packages
└── docs/           # Documentation
```

## Target Structure
```
epicenter/
├── apps/
│   ├── whispering/  # Renamed from 'app' - the Whispering transcription app
│   ├── sh/          # epicenter.sh - unchanged
│   ├── cli/         # Epicenter CLI - unchanged
│   └── api/         # API service - unchanged

## README Structure Plan

### New Root README.md Structure

# Epicenter

Own your data. Use any model. Free and open source. ❤️

## What is Epicenter?

Epicenter is an ecosystem of open-source tools that put you in control of your AI interactions. No middlemen, no subscriptions, no data collection. Just direct connections to the AI providers of your choice.

## The Epicenter Ecosystem

### 🎙️ [Whispering](./apps/whispering)
Press shortcut → speak → get text. A desktop transcription app that cuts out the middleman.
- Pay actual API costs (as low as $0.02/hour)
- Your audio never touches our servers
- Works with Groq, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, or completely offline

### 🤖 [epicenter.sh](./apps/sh)
Self-hosted AI coding assistants with a clean web interface.
- Connect to OpenCode servers locally or through tunnels
- Your code stays on your machine
- Flexible deployment options

### 🛠️ [Epicenter CLI](./apps/cli)
The unified command-line interface for the Epicenter ecosystem.
- Smart defaults for OpenCode integration
- Automatic port discovery and tunneling
- Zero-config setup

## Why Epicenter?

We believe AI tools should be:
- **Transparent**: Open source code you can audit
- **Private**: Your data stays on your devices
- **Affordable**: Pay providers directly, not middleman markups
- **Flexible**: Use any model, any provider, any deployment

## Quick Start

## Development

[Monorepo setup and development instructions...]
```

### Whispering App README.md Structure
The current README content will be moved to `apps/whispering/README.md` with minimal changes, maintaining all the detailed documentation about the transcription app.

## Benefits of This Migration

1. **Clear Brand Identity**: Epicenter as the umbrella brand for open-source AI tools
2. **Better Organization**: Each app has its own clear space and documentation
3. **Easier Onboarding**: Users understand the ecosystem at a glance
4. **Maintained History**: The Whispering app keeps its identity within the ecosystem
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new tools to the Epicenter ecosystem

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Breaking Changes**: Update paths carefully, test all imports
2. **User Confusion**: Clear communication about the rebranding
3. **SEO Impact**: Maintain redirects if changing repository name
4. **Documentation Links**: Audit and update all internal/external links

## Timeline Estimate

- Phase 1-2: 2-3 hours (structure and branding)
- Phase 3-5: 1-2 hours (configurations and documentation)
- Phase 6: 2-4 hours (code sharing analysis)
- Testing: 1-2 hours

Total: ~8-10 hours of focused work

- **Maintained Functionality**: All apps continue to work as expected
- **Simplified Onboarding**: New contributors can understand the project structure at a glance

### Remaining Tasks

While the core migration is complete, these optional tasks could further improve the ecosystem:

1. **Code Sharing Analysis**: Identify common components between apps for potential extraction to packages
2. **CI/CD Updates**: Update GitHub Actions and deployment scripts if needed
3. **Repository Rename**: Consider renaming the GitHub repository from "whispering" to "epicenter"
4. **Documentation Links**: Update any external links pointing to the old structure

### Summary

The migration from "Whispering" to "Epicenter" has been successfully implemented. The project now has a clear brand identity as an ecosystem of privacy-focused AI tools, with Whispering maintaining its identity as the flagship transcription app within that ecosystem. The new structure is more scalable and makes it easier to add new tools to the Epicenter family.
