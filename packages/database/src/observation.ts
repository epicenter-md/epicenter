/**
 * @fileoverview What a bound handle reports when its data may be stale.
 *
 * One rule decides the shape of everything here: a bound handle reports when
 * data reachable *through it* may be stale. A table handle can usually name the
 * rows that moved, because every fact carries a row id the replica already
 * emitted; when it cannot, it says so with table scope rather than guessing.
 *
 * # The laws
 *
 * 1. **Invalidation is a superset.** It may over-report and must never
 *    under-report. Every consumer downstream is allowed to re-read more than it
 *    strictly had to; none is allowed to miss a change.
 * 2. **Registration is synchronous, does no I/O, and never fires initially.** A
 *    caller that subscribes and then reads has already seen everything: the
 *    subscription was installed before the read started.
 * 3. **One invalidation per committed replica notification per logical table.**
 *    A commit that touches sixty-four rows of one table calls a listener once
 *    with sixty-four ids, not sixty-four times.
 * 4. **Delivery may duplicate.** Consumers converge idempotently.
 * 5. **A table-scope invalidation supersedes in-flight incremental work.** It
 *    says "everything reachable here may be stale", which is strictly stronger
 *    than any set of row ids still being processed.
 * 6. **A carrier gap heals locally.** When an observation carrier reconnects,
 *    the client emits table scope to every subscribed table. Nothing on the wire
 *    encodes reconnection, reset, or scope; the client that noticed the gap is
 *    the one that knows which handles were listening across it.
 *
 * Law 6 is why `scope: 'table'` exists at all. Without it the only honest
 * response to a gap would be to fail the handle closed and make the app reload,
 * because a deletion that happened while the socket was down cannot be
 * enumerated: the row is gone, so there is nothing left to name it with.

/**
 * What a table handle reports when rows reachable through it may be stale.
 *
 * `rows` names exactly the row ids that a commit touched. `table` says the
 * handle cannot name them, so everything reachable through it may have moved.
 * Both arms are objects with a `scope` discriminant on purpose: the rejected
 * `readonly string[] | 'all'` compiles when a caller forgets to narrow, and
 * then iterates `'all'` as the three row ids `a`, `l`, `l`.
 *
 * `rowIds` is an ordinary `readonly string[]`. The runtime never emits an empty
 * one, but a non-empty tuple type in the public surface would make every caller
 * carry a constraint that only the producer can violate.
