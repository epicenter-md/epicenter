/**
 * This device's files and secrets, scoped to one application (ADR-0321,
 * ADR-0310).
 *
 * The package name is the axis. `@epicenter/data` is an ACCOUNT's data: it is
 * principal-scoped, it is the same on every runtime, and it travels with the
 * person. This is a DEVICE's: it has no principal, it varies by runtime, and it
 * stays on the machine. That difference is invariant 4 of the account model,
 * which is why the two are separate packages rather than two namespaces on one
 * handle: a person removing their local data removes a replica, and never a
 * file or a secret.
 *
 * An application never selects OPFS, Bun SQLite, a native path, a keychain, or
 * a host IPC mechanism, because none of those names appear on this surface. It
 * selects a runtime through its own `#platform/device` seam and calls one of
 * the two constructors. There is no `typeof window` test and there must not be
 * one: the desktop build runs in a WebView, so a runtime sniff cannot tell it
 * apart from a browser tab. A build that forgot to declare its condition fails
 * to resolve rather than silently running the wrong owner.
 *
 * Runtime differences are typed failures, never branches (ADR-0181). A browser
 * build has no keychain, so its secret leaf answers from tab memory and forgets
 * everything on close; the application handles that because a `Result` obliges
 * it to.
