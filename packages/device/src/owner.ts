/**
 * What owns application SQLite files, and the one handle every caller holds
 * over one.
 *
 * Three transports reach an owner and there are only ever two owners. The
 * desktop page sends `DeviceRequest` over same-origin HTTP to a Bun
 * process that owns files below the Epicenter data root; the browser page
 * sends the same request over `postMessage` to a worker that owns an OPFS
 * pool; the Bun host answers itself. What differs between those is a socket
 * and an envelope, so that is all each transport writes: the handle, the
 * dispatch, and the meaning of every message are here, once.
 *
 * This is the shape the codebase already had in three places without naming
 * it. `BunDevice` and the browser leaf's SQLite owner were the same two
 * methods declared twice, and `apps/epicenter`'s route carried the only
 * request-to-owner dispatcher, where no other transport could reach it.

 * closing the connection to it, which the application cannot do because it
 * never had the handle (ADR-0321).
 *
 * `open` never means "create a session". Both owners resolve a name to a live
 * connection and cache it, so a caller that opens the same name twice gets one
 * connection and a caller that opens after a delete gets a new empty file.
 * That is why nothing on this type closes: closing is a step inside `delete`.
