/**
 * Messages exchanged by an application handle and the trusted desktop owner.
 *
 * Two concerns cross this seam and only two: running statements against an
 * application-owned SQLite file or deleting one, and holding one labeled
 * secret. Every message names the application, because the owner scopes
 * everything it does by that identity rather than by the socket it arrived on.
 *
 * Opening data was never one of them. The store is client-owned in every
 * runtime (ADR-0226) and a deployed app is a trusted app (ADR-0334), so it
 * never crossed this seam; it is not on the binding either any more
 * (ADR-0339). A definition is a TypeScript module a host imports from its own
 * release (ADR-0313); there is no JSON spelling of one, and this protocol has
 * no message that would carry it.

/**
 * The names this protocol admits, owned here because both ends read them.
 *
 * They lived in two places until they were moved: the client validated before
 * sending and the host validated on arrival, with the same two regular
 * expressions written out twice. That is how a client starts refusing what a
 * server accepts, or worse, the other way round.
 *
 * The application id reuses `isAppId`, which is the grammar that already names
 * a directory below the one Epicenter data root, so a name this protocol admits
 * and a name that can be a directory are one question with one answer. It is
 * imported from `@epicenter/constants/app-id` rather than `/app-data`, because
 * that module resolves an OS path and would drag `node:os` into every page that
 * bundles this one.

/**
 * One SQLite file name this platform admits, checked wherever one is minted.
 *
 * Branded, so the check happens once at the name rather than once per call.
 * `epicenter.sqlite.open` used to re-run it on every open and every delete,
 * and `secrets` on every put, get, and delete: six guards answering one
 * question about a string that, in every caller here, is either a constant in
 * the build or a value the application already had to validate to report
 * something useful about it. Local Mail's `mail-<sub>` is the whole population
 * of derived names, and `finishConnect` already refused a subject that could
 * not be one, because "we cannot file your mail under that" is a sentence only
 * the application can write.
 *
 * The desktop owner still validates on arrival (`apps/epicenter/src/server.ts`),
 * which is where a check has to live anyway: a brand is a compile-time fact,
 * and a request crossing the sidecar carries no types.
