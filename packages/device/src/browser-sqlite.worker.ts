/**
 * The browser's SQLite owner, in the one context that can be one.
 *
 * **A worker is not a performance choice here, it is where the API exists.**
 * OPFS synchronous access handles are exposed to dedicated workers and nowhere
 * else: `FileSystemFileHandle.createSyncAccessHandle` is `undefined` on the
 * main thread, with cross-origin isolation and without it, on both engines
 * Epicenter targets. The leaf this replaced called `new sqlite3.oo1.OpfsDb()`
 * from the page, which could never have opened anything.
 *
 * **The VFS is `installOpfsSAHPoolVfs`, not `oo1.OpfsDb`.** Both need a
 * worker; only the second also needs the page cross-origin isolated, which
 * would put `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` on
 * every response that ever serves an Epicenter bundle and break any
 * cross-origin subresource an application renders. The pool asks nothing of
 * the host, so where a build can be served stays a hosting question.
 *
 * **A pool owns its directory exclusively, so a second tab has no storage.**
 * Measured on both engines: the second tab's install throws (Chromium
 * `NoModificationAllowedError`, WebKit `InvalidStateError`) and the first
 * tab's databases are untouched and survive a relaunch. The engines disagree
 * about the words, so the page turns it into one sentence rather than showing
 * either. The library caches a failed install per VFS name, which is why the
 * retry below asks it not to.
