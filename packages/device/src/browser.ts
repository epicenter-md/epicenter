/**
 * The browser binding: origin-owned SQLite over OPFS in a worker, and secrets
 * that live exactly as long as the tab (ADR-0310).
 *
 * This is the reduced build. It has no keychain and no host, so it holds no
 * credential across a reload, deliberately and permanently: not `localStorage`,
 * not IndexedDB, and not encrypted in the page, because a key the page can
 * derive is a key anything in the origin can derive.
 *
 * **This leaf builds storage, not a data session.** Nothing about a session
 * varies by runtime; an OPFS file and a keychain do. So this is what an
 * application selects per build, while one `createEpicenter` in
 * `@epicenter/app` serves every build.
 *
 * The runtime is still the import path, never a runtime test: a WebView cannot
 * be told from a tab by anything observable at runtime, so the build answers
 * it. An application that needs the owner its platform actually has reaches
 * this through its own `#platform/*` seam.

 * The transport is built per call, because one tab has one OPFS and therefore
 * one storage worker; the application scope is the name the worker files
 * under, exactly as it is for the Bun owner.
 *
 * `open` cannot fail here, which is the same thing the desktop leaf says: it
 * resolves a name to a handle rather than a connection, and whether the file
 * can be opened at all is answered by the first statement through it. Handing
 * back a `Result` anyway keeps one contract across runtimes.
