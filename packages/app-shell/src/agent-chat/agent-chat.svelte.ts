/**
 * Reactive AI chat state shared by every chat app: the conversation registry
 * plus one client agent loop (ADR-0047) per conversation, with each app's
 * differences injected rather than forked.
 *
 * The conversation list is a `conversations` table the app spliced into its own
 * workspace shape (@epicenter/chat), in whichever document the app's root
 * chose for this generation (ADR-0233); each row's turns live at the `messages`
 * root inside that row's own document. A handle registry mirrors the table:
 * {@link createAgentChatState} opens a handle for every row and disposes one
 * whose row is gone. Each handle binds that row's messages to the loop through
 * `bindAgentConversation`; the loop streams the live turn into component state
 * and writes each finished message into the document the moment the turn ends.
 * The live turn never enters the CRDT, and the loop dies with the tab.
 *
 * Everything here is synchronous, which is what the store being synchronous
 * buys: a read is a property access on a document already in memory, a row's
 * document is already allocated beside the row (ADR-0215), and `subscribe`
 * reports a commit after the projection has caught up (ADR-0187). So there is
 * no `whenReady`, no in-flight-handle set, and no awaiting a document lease;
 * a handle exists for a row the instant the registry hears about it.
 *
 * Inference rides the OpenAI-compatible gateway (ADR-0049/0050). The engine is
 * built here, once: per turn it resolves the conversation's model (ADR-0055)
 * against this device's connection registry (ADR-0059, `resolve`) and
 * reads the app's system prompts. What the agent can do is grouped into one
 * `agent` bundle ({@link AgentKit}), since every field of it varies with the
 * app's persona; the loop's other collaborators are passed alongside:
 *
 * - `agent.buildSystemPrompts`  the layered prompts an answer is generated under.
 * - `agent.toolCatalog`         the live tool surface; omit for a capability-free app.
 * - `agent.decideApproval`      the per-call approval policy; defaults to query-runs,
 *                               mutation-asks. The synchronous pause is owned here.
 * - `agent.defaultModel`        the model a brand new conversation starts on.
 * - `activeConversation`        the active-conversation source; defaults to internal
 *                               state. An app that keeps it in the URL injects its own.
 *
 * A mutation is approval-gated by a synchronous pause: the loop waits on an
 * in-client decision, recorded per handle in `pendingApproval`. The "Always
 * Allow" trust action lives in the app, composed from the handle's exposed
 * `pendingApprovalToolName` plus `approveToolCall`; this module never knows about
 * a trust set.
 *
 * The draft a user is typing lives per conversation on the handle (`inputValue`),
 * so switching conversations keeps each one's unsent text.
