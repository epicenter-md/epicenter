/**
 * The SQLite projector: turn a classified folder into a typed table.
 *
 * `matter.sqlite` sits next to `matter.json` as a derived, disposable, READ-ONLY
 * mirror so a coding agent (or an in-app SQL console) can run arbitrary SQL over the
 * typed folder. The live in-app grid stays reactive JS over the projection; this is
 * the external read surface, not the app's query engine.
 *
 * This module is the PURE half: given the contract and the classified rows, it produces
 * the schema script (`DROP` + `CREATE`) and the row tuples to insert. The impure half
 * (writing the file) is a thin Tauri command that runs the script and parameter-binds
 * the rows; keeping serialization here makes it unit-testable with no filesystem.
 *
 * Three properties define the table:
 *   - Every READABLE row, valid or not. A folder of drafts is mostly incomplete, and
 *     the whole point of the WHERE filter (and of an agent triaging the folder) is to
 *     find those drafts ("my carousel posts that still need a publishDate"), so a row
 *     is included whether or not every field is filled. Only unparseable FILES are
 *     absent, they never became a row; their broken text stays in the markdown.
 *   - Field columns are nullable. A missing cell (MISSING_REQUIRED or
 *     MISSING_OPTIONAL) binds NULL; an out-of-domain value (INVALID) binds its raw
 *     value, which SQLite's flexible typing stores regardless of the column's declared
 *     affinity. So a draft is still filterable on the fields it does have.
 *   - No CHECK. Validation lives once, at classify time (the grid shows conformance
 *     per cell, amber for missing required, red for out-of-domain); the mirror just
 *     mirrors, so a SQL CHECK would only reject the very drafts the filter exists to
 *     surface.
 *
 * Two more columns sit beside the typed fields: `_extra` (the untyped frontmatter keys, as JSON) and
 * `body` (the row's markdown prose). When the contract is searchable, the script also emits an FTS5
 * virtual table over the searchable columns plus the trigger that the INSERT loop fires, so prose and
 * text fields are full-text queryable.
