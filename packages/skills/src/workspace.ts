/**
 * Skills' inert data definition: the definition id it owns and the two
 * tables in it.
 *
 * A data definition is pure JSON (ADR-0213, ADR-0240): closed field
 * descriptors, and nothing that knows about storage, sync, or
 * documents. The `skills` and `skillReferences` property names are the durable
 * table names, so they are what row addresses carry and what the projection's
 * relations are called.
 *
 * Structural row ids are minted by the store. `sourceId` is the portable
 * agentskills.io identity kept in SKILL.md frontmatter; it may be used to match
 * a later import, and it never becomes record identity.
