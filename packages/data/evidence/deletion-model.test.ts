/**
 * Whether clear-and-flag buys anything a reader can see.
 *
 * `deleteRow` clears a row's fields and flags it absent rather than removing it
 * from the table root, and its own comment gives the reason: "Deleting the row's
 * attribute instead destroys a concurrent edit; clearing fields and flagging
 * converges with the tombstone held and the peer's edit retained."
 *
 * That costs about 8 items per dead row against 2 for removal, which is 458 MB
 * against 100 MB over a decade of ordinary churn (`evidence/bench/tombstones.ts`).
 * At that price the benefit has to be real, so these tests ask what a reader
 * actually observes under each model rather than what the CRDT retains.
