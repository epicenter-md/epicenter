/**
 * What an authority still holds after you delete something, and for how long.
 *
 * This file has been rewritten twice, and the reason is worth stating because
 * it is the hazard evidence files have: it kept passing while describing a
 * system that was not deployed. Its first claim was about the positional log,
 * ADR-0277 replaced that log with a document-holding server, and the file was
 * rewritten to measure the replacement. ADR-0298 deleted the replacement,
 * which was never routed to anything, so the positional log is the shipped
 * design again and this measures it again.
 *
 * The claim, and it is not a comfortable one: **a byte-blind authority
 * retains deleted content, and a fresh device is sent it.** The authority
 * stores opaque updates and forwards them, so the update that created a row
 * is still a row in the log after the row is deleted, and catch-up from
 * position zero replays it. Nothing on the server collects it, because
 * collecting requires reading the bytes.
 *
 * What removes it is the SNAPSHOT, and the snapshot comes from a client. A
 * client encodes its own garbage-collected document and offers it; the
 * authority verifies only that the connection was sent through the offered
 * position, replaces the snapshot, and forgets every entry the snapshot
 * covers. So retention is bounded by snapshot cadence, and the party that
 * does the collecting is the one that can read the bytes.
 *
 * Evidence for `shouldSnapshot`, for `replaceSnapshot`, and for what ADR-0298
 * accepts by keeping the authority blind. Not a product workflow.
