/**
 * What it costs to never compact the authority's log.
 *
 * Run: `bun run evidence/bench/never-compact.ts`
 * Method: `@y/y@14.0.0-rc.24`, `gc: true`, Bun, one process. Byte counts are
 * `updateV2` lengths as they would be appended; replay is a fresh document
 * applying every entry in order.
 *
 * The question this answers is whether refusing compaction is affordable. If it
 * is, the authority never needs to prove that a replacement covers what it
 * replaces, which is the requirement every failed design so far has been trying
 * to satisfy cheaply.
 *
 * The variable that turns out to matter most is not on the authority at all. A
 * client may merge its OWN unsent updates before sending, which it can always
 * do correctly because it owns them, and which needs no proof from anybody. So
 * the log grows with SENDS, not with transactions, and the send rate is a
 * client-side choice.
