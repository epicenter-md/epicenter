/**
 * What a note list costs while somebody types, and whether the fine-grained
 * signal is what protects it.
 *
 * Run: `bun run evidence/bench/list-per-keystroke.ts`
 *
 * ADR-0294 measured the document and declared that "memory is the only
 * constraint; time is not". That is a statement about opening and reading a
 * document, and it is true. It is not a statement about the SCREEN, and the
 * two-signal design (`subscribe` for a table's shape, `watch` for one live
 * type) is defended entirely by a screen cost nobody has instrumented.
 *
 * The question this answers is narrower and decidable. Honeycrisp sorts notes
 * by `updatedAt` and writes `{ title, updatedAt }` back to the row from a
 * coalescer hung on the node signal, so a keystroke in an open note produces
 * TWO commits: the node edit, and the derived row write. The list must wake
 * for the second one under any design, because the note it names has just
 * moved to the top.
 *
 * So the fine signal does not spare the list a wake-up. It halves them:
 *
 *   three signals   the list re-derives once per keystroke  (the row write)
 *   one signal      the list re-derives twice               (node, then row)
 *
 * What that costs is a number, and this is the number.
 *
 * METHOD:
 *   - The REAL store (`openMemory`), not a hand-rolled Yjs model. Every
 *     earlier attempt in this subsystem to reason from a model gave the wrong
 *     answer, three separate times.
 *   - `visibleNotes` is reproduced exactly as the application derives it: read
 *     `rows`, drop the deleted, sort by `updatedAt` descending.
 *   - The corpus build is outside the timed region.
 *   - A LIVENESS control: every case asserts the derive returned the rows it
 *     should have and that the typed character actually landed, so a case that
 *     silently measured nothing reads as a failure rather than as a win.
