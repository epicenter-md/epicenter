/**
 * What a per-table subscription costs per commit, and what it scales with.
 *
 * Run: `bun run evidence/bench/subscription.ts`
 *
 * The question the store's `subscribe` had to answer before it was written.
 * ADR-0187 chose row ids over a void signal because "simplicity here is paid
 * for on every commit, forever", which is only the right trade if the ids are
 * close to free. A `'delta'` listener is not free: attaching one is what makes
 * a `YType` build and emit its delta, so the cost lands on every write whether
 * or not the change is small.
 *
 * What matters is the SHAPE of the cost, not its absolute size. If it scales
 * with the table it is a tax on having data; if it scales with the change it is
 * a tax on making one, and only the second is affordable on a large vault.
 *
 * METHOD:
 *   - One process, but every case runs against a freshly built document, so a
 *     case never inherits the previous one's structs or its warmed caches.
 *   - The corpus build is outside the timed region. Only the commits are timed.
 *   - Every case is paired with a NO-SUBSCRIBER control on the same corpus and
 *     the same commits, so the reported cost is the difference rather than the
 *     machine.
 *   - A LIVENESS control: the subscribed run asserts it actually collected the
 *     row ids it should have. A run where the listener silently stopped firing
 *     would otherwise report the cheapest possible number and read as a win.
