/**
 * What a brand-new device pays to join a vault that has been lived in.
 *
 * Run: `bun run evidence/bench/first-sync.ts`
 *
 * ADR-0220 claims a returning or brand-new replica downloads CURRENT STATE PLUS
 * A SHORT TAIL rather than all history. Nothing measured it. That matters here
 * more than usual, because the neighbouring claim in the same record, that
 * replacing the log with a snapshot makes storage CONSTANT, did not survive
 * `evidence/bench/flat-storage.ts`: a snapshot carries the accumulated delete
 * set, so storage tracks lifetime deletions rather than staying flat. A record
 * that was wrong once about the storage axis is worth checking on the join axis.
 *
 * The workload is a vault that has been USED, not one that was just created:
 * 986 notes with 2.8 KB prose bodies (the real vault's shape, the same corpus
 * `never-compact.ts` and `memory.ts` build), then N days of typing, renaming,
 * deleting and creating on top. History behind the current state is the entire
 * point; a freshly created vault cannot distinguish the two designs at all.
 *
 * The control column is produced by simply never snapshotting, which is what
 * ADR-0217 specified. So the two columns are the two DESIGNS over one identical
 * workload, not two benchmarks with different corpora.
 *
 * METHOD, which this directory enforces:
 *
 *   - ONE OS PROCESS PER MEASURED CASE, for the reason `memory.ts` spells out.
 *     Several shapes in one process report the allocator's high-water mark for
 *     the first and near zero after; an earlier bench here returned NEGATIVE
 *     heap deltas because of exactly that. Timing has the same problem in a
 *     milder form, since a warmed JIT and a heap full of the previous case's
 *     garbage are not the arriving phone's conditions.
 *   - Building and measuring are also separate processes. The build process
 *     replays days of edits and writes the exact bytes the hub would send a
 *     cursor-0 connection to a file; the measuring process reads that file into
 *     an empty replica and times the apply. Building in-process would put the
 *     resident replica's whole document in the same heap as the arriving one.
 *   - EVERY CASE CARRIES A CONTROL THAT FAILS IF THE TEST IS NOT LIVE. The
 *     arriving replica must END UP WITH THE VAULT: its live row count, and one
 *     named note's title and full prose body read back out of its row document.
 *     A run that transferred nothing would otherwise post the best numbers on
 *     the table. There is also a negative control at the bottom, an arrival
 *     given an empty payload, which must FAIL that verification.
 *   - The snapshot floor is the shipped 64 KB. Nothing is injected, because a
 *     real-sized vault is two orders of magnitude above the floor and the ratio
 *     rule is what actually governs. The tests inject a floor; a bench at real
 *     scale must not, or it measures a policy nobody runs.
 *
 * Anything not measured is printed as not measured.
 *
 * ## What it found, so nobody has to run it to know
 *
 * The claim does not survive in the form ADR-0220 states it. "A short tail" is
 * not what a joining device gets. The tail is bounded, which is the real and
 * worthwhile difference from an append-only log, but the bound is roughly TWICE
 * the current state rather than something small, so a new phone pays between one
 * and three times the vault for its first sync depending on when in the cycle it
 * arrives.
 *
 * The mechanism is visible in the table and is not the one the policy comment
 * describes. `shouldSnapshot` compares the tail against `sumBytes('_snapshot')`,
 * and the authority retains TWO snapshot positions so that a bad snapshot has a
 * way back, so the number the tail has to beat is the sum of both retained
 * snapshots rather than the live one. `authority.ts` says the trigger "bounds
 * both at about twice the state"; measured, it bounds the tail alone at about
 * twice the state and the transfer at about three times it.
 *
 * The consequence is that replacements are RARE at real scale. Over 240
 * simulated days on this corpus the snapshot moved exactly once after the vault
 * was created, at day 48 or so. Between replacements the snapshot design decays
 * back toward the log: just after a replacement it costs a joining device 2.9x
 * fewer entries and 2.7x less time than the log, and six months later that is
 * down to 17 percent fewer entries and 13 percent less time. The number to quote
 * is not an average, it is a sawtooth, and where a device lands on it is luck.
 *
 * Time and bytes do not move together, which is the other reason to report both.
 * Applying is per ENTRY, at a flat 2.3 to 2.8 ms each, because every entry is
 * one commit on the arriving device. So the snapshot design's advantage is
 * mostly in entry count and only slightly in bytes: the 60-day row transfers 14
 * percent fewer bytes than its control and takes 64 percent less time.
 *
 * Running it takes about six minutes, nearly all of it replaying histories in
 * the build processes. That is the cost of a corpus at real scale rather than a
 * tuned-down one, and it is not a measurement of anything.
