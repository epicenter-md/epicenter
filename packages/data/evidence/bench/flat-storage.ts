/**
 * What the authority's storage actually tracks.
 *
 * Run: `bun run evidence/bench/flat-storage.ts`
 *
 * ADR-0220 first claimed that replacing the log with a snapshot and a tail makes
 * storage CONSTANT. This bench was written to check that and the claim did not
 * survive it, which is the specific failure this corpus keeps catching in its
 * own records: the never-compacted log was priced at 4 MB a year and the real
 * bill turned out to be something else entirely.
 *
 * Storage is not constant. A snapshot is current state, and current state
 * carries the accumulated DELETE SET, so the authority holds live rows plus
 * roughly one tombstone per row ever deleted. It grows with lifetime deletions
 * rather than with the operation count, which is a real improvement over an
 * append-only log and is not the same as flat.
 *
 * The shape here is a working vault: rows are created, edited and deleted
 * continuously, so the live set stays roughly flat while the number of
 * operations grows without bound. If the claim holds, stored bytes settle and
 * the tail keeps getting cut; if it does not, the line climbs.
 *
 * The CONTROL is the same run with snapshots switched off, which must climb. A
 * table where both columns are flat would mean the workload was too small to
 * show anything, and a bench that cannot fail is decoration.
