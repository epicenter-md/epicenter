/**
 * What a detached `Y.Type` can and cannot do, pinned.
 *
 * A codec builds its own type field and hands it to `create` (ADR-0296, as
 * amended), so what a detached type is safe for is now a correctness
 * constraint on every codec anyone writes. This file is that constraint, in
 * executable form, because `@y/y` is an RC and the amendment is only as good as
 * the behaviour it rests on.
 *
 * The rule in one sentence: **a detached type accumulates one prelim delta, and
 * a delta is positional.** Anything computed against the state it will actually
 * land on is safe; a sequence of independent positional writes is not, because
 * each is computed against an empty type and they all land at index 0.
