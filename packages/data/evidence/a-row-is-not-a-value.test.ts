/**
 * A row is a read, not a value. Pinned, because nothing in the type says so.
 *
 * `get` hands back a plain object literal, and plain objects are comparable,
 * cloneable and serializable. This one is not: the content node on it IS the
 * container in the document (ADR-0296, amended), so the object is half snapshot
 * and half handle. TypeScript cannot express "do not clone me", so the contract
 * lives here instead of in a signature.
 *
 * This was found rather than designed. `readArtifact`'s round trip compared
 * `restored.tables.notes.rows` with `data.tables.notes.rows` and started failing
 * the moment rows carried their types, because two documents' `Y.Type`s carry
 * different client ids. The fix was to compare the faithful read, which is what
 * that assertion should always have used: "imports back whole" is a claim about
 * the record, not about the lens.
 *
 * So: **when you need a value, ask the store, not the table.** `store.stored()`
 * for everything and `store.rowFile(table, id)` for one row both answer in
 * plain JSON, and both are faithful where the lens narrows.
