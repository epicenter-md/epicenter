/**
 * Why the authority validates nothing: the record of a mechanism that was cut.
 *
 * **Nothing measured here is in the transport.** `src/sync/authority.ts` makes
 * no Yjs call at all and never reads the bytes it stores. This file is kept
 * because the argument for that is a measurement, and deleting the measurement
 * would leave only an assertion, one that "surely the server should check the
 * update is valid" would overturn in an afternoon.
 *
 * The design memo said the authority calls `encodeStateVectorFromUpdateV2` on
 * the reassembled update, keeps only whether it threw, and that "that is what
 * closes the poison pill". Two things there are wrong, and both matter:
 *
 * 1. That call is the WEAKEST of the candidates. An update truncated by one
 *    byte passes it and throws on every device that applies it, which is the
 *    exact failure it was chosen to prevent.
 * 2. NOTHING the authority can call closes the poison pill, including applying
 *    the update to a throwaway document. Whether bytes throw depends on the
 *    structs the RECEIVER already holds, and the authority holds none by
 *    definition, so the receiver's predicate is not available to it.
 *
 * So every candidate was a filter and none was a proof. `diffUpdateV2` was the
 * strongest of them and shipped for a while; it was removed once the rest of its
 * bill was counted, being the most expensive step in an append, the only
 * coupling between the server and Yjs's version, and the one thing that made
 * end-to-end encryption impossible. What actually bounds the damage is that a
 * partition has one writer principal, so the only party who can author bytes
 * that brick it is the party that owns it, and what recovers from it is that
 * every log entry is individually addressable and a replica names the position
 * it is stuck at (`src/sync/transport.test.ts`).
 *
 * These tests measure the candidates against ground truth, a real receiver.
 * Nothing here asserts an exact count, because counts move with the corpus; the
 * ORDERING and the DIRECTION are the properties.
