 * The document as the store lays it out, reachable without the store.

 * layout, so going through a table handle would prove nothing about it. What
 * it does not need is to re-learn, at every line, how to say that layout to
 * the compiler.
 *
 * `Y.Type`'s default configuration types no attributes at all, so `keyof` its
 * attribute map is empty and the key parameter of `getAttr` and `setAttr`
 * narrows to `never`. Every raw access therefore had to lie twice: once about
 * the key, once about what came back. That is a property of the library's
 * generic default, not of anything Epicenter decided, and naming the
 * configuration once is all it takes to stop repeating the lie.
 *
 * `src/store/document.ts` already solved this for production with the same
 * two lines, for the same reason, and its `RowType` is deliberately not
 * exported: it is the CRDT shape a row happens to have, which that module
 * exists to keep inside. This is the evidence-side twin, and it stays here.
