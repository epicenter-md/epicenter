/**
 * What a body rewrite costs two devices, measured rather than reasoned about.
 *
 * `ContentCodec.rewrite` clears a node's content and refills it, on the node
 * the row already holds (ADR-0338). The alternative it was chosen over is
 * setting a fresh node over the row's `content` attribute, and the argument
 * for choosing it was that a replacement resolves by attribute
 * last-writer-wins, so one device loses its entire subtree.
 *
 * That argument is only worth the verb if the rewrite is actually better, and
 * "better" is not "lossless". These pin exactly what survives, so the record
 * can say it and a person can be told it.
