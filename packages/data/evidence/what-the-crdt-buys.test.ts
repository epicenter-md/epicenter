/**
 * What the CRDT actually buys, field by field.
 *
 * The entire tombstone problem, and with it generations, rebuilds, migration,
 * frozen generations and retention windows, exists because rows live in a CRDT.
 * That is worth paying for only where a CRDT does something a simpler rule
 * cannot. So: measure where it does.
 *
 * The answer splits cleanly, and not where you would guess.
 *
 * - **Scalar fields get last-writer-wins already.** A Yjs map discards one of
 *   two concurrent writes to the same key, exactly as a plain timestamped table
 *   would, and the survivor is chosen by clientID ordering rather than by who
 *   edited last. It is a coin flip, not a merge.
 * - **Prose genuinely merges.** Two concurrent insertions into one string both
 *   survive, interleaved correctly. No last-writer-wins scheme can do this.
 *
 * So for a row's scalars the CRDT provides a marginally different tie-break and
 * charges the whole tombstone machine for it. Pinned because "we need a CRDT
 * for rows" is an assumption nobody re-examines once it is in the walls.
