/**
 * A row becomes one file (ADR-0268, ADR-0337, ADR-0296).
 *
 * This is the unit, and everything else is iteration: a whole render is the
 * same call in a loop. The artifact used to be assembled the other way around,
 * whole-store first,
 * because ADR-0267's layout put a row's fields and its document in two
 * separate trees correlated by coordinates. ADR-0268 collapsed that layout
 * into one file per row; this is the code catching up to it. A row's fields
 * and its content node go in the same file, so they are read in the same function
 * and never rejoined.
 *
 * **The platform owns the format; the table owns the mapping** (ADR-0296).
 * What is here is the fence: the frontmatter block, the blank separator, and
 * the body beneath it. What the codec answers is which values go above the
 * fence and what text goes below it.
 *
 * Composed on the opened data's public surface, so it is a follower and never
 * a store verb. It reads; nothing it returns can reach back in.
