/**
 * The artifact read back: files in, one document out (ADR-0267, ADR-0268,
 * ADR-0295).
 *
 * The mirror of `renderArtifact`, and deliberately the same kind of thing: a
 * pure function over the public vocabulary, composed outside the store. It
 * rebuilds the database's one Yjs document from every row file, mints each
 * row with its content node, and hands the table's codec the parsed
 * frontmatter and the body beneath it.
 *
 * Producing bytes rather than writing them is what keeps import honest about
 * where the destruction happens. Replacing a store means discarding its
 * durable record and letting it refill (ADR-0231's supersession), which is an
 * act on an address rather than on a live store, and belongs to whoever owns
 * the address. This function is the half that can be tested by reading its
 * output, and it holds no handle to anything a mistake could destroy.
 *
 * It fails closed, for the same reason the export does not: what comes out of
 * here replaces a store, so a file it could not read is a refusal rather than
 * a row quietly left out. `decode` runs once per row for every database
 * that will ever exist, because import is the only way a generation comes
 * into being (ADR-0293), which is rare in frequency and absolute in role.
