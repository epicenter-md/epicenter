/**
 * The frontmatter half of a row's export file (ADR-0268).
 *
 * One block of YAML above the body, carrying the row's raw stored fields. The
 * emitter is deliberately a subset of YAML chosen for exact round-trips:
 * every string is emitted as a JSON string (a valid YAML double-quoted
 * scalar), numbers, booleans, and null emit bare, and compound values emit as
 * JSON (valid YAML flow style). Nothing bare can ever be re-read as another
 * type, so `"007"` and `"no"` survive as the strings they are; the artifact
 * is lossy of history, never of a value (ADR-0267/0268).
 *
 * Keys are sorted, so two exports of one store diff line by line. A key
 * outside the declared field grammar (a value an older release wrote) is
 * emitted as a JSON-quoted key, which YAML also accepts.
 *
 * Reading is the same subset, plus one concession to the person the artifact
 * exists for: a value this emitter would have quoted and a hand editor did
 * not is read as the string it looks like. That can only ever produce a
 * string, so a hand edit cannot change a value's type by accident; what it
 * cannot rescue is a hand-typed `007`, which reads as the number YAML has
 * always read it as.
