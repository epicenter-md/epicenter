/**
 * The working copy in `~/Epicenter`, and the wire it travels on (ADR-0337).
 *
 * **A push applies the folder, whole, after one approval** (ADR-0338). It
 * validates nothing, deletes a row when its file is gone, reads a removed
 * frontmatter line as `null`, and asks nothing per item: to change any of it,
 * a person cancels, edits the file, and pushes again. A setting in `kv.json`
 * comes back the same way a frontmatter value does.
 *
 * ```txt
 * ~/Epicenter/<data-id>/
 *   .epicenter/manifest.json     what pull handed over, and from where
 *   <table>/<row-id>.md          one row, frontmatter and body
 *   kv.json                      the kv root's stored values
 * ```
 *
 * `pull` fills the folder, `push` sends it back, and nothing happens in
 * between. The continuous mirror this replaces asked the folder to be four
 * things at once, and the fourth, a surface external tools could edit, is
 * where every hard question came from: a filesystem cannot say whether a
 * missing file is a person deleting a note, a `git checkout`, a half-finished
 * Dropbox sync, or a Time Machine restore.
 *
 * **The manifest is the base**, which is what makes those the same question
 * with one answer. `pull` wrote down what it handed over and when, so at push
 * a changed value is an edit and a missing file is a deletion, and there is no
 * watcher, no echo suppression, and no per-file base store to keep. A deletion
 * lands as a deletion: the row goes, and it does not pass through the
 * application's trash on the way (ADR-0338). `PlanItem` is the whole
 * vocabulary of what a plan can say and what may be answered to it.
 *
 * ## Who owns which half
 *
 * The application renders, diffs, and decides. The host writes the files it is
 * handed and reads back the files it holds, and interprets neither: nothing on
 * that side parses frontmatter or reaches a row. ADR-0271 refused a host that
 * reads the folder at all, in service of a one-way rule that is withdrawn, and
 * the narrower refusal is the one that survives.
 *
 * The wire itself is `wire.js`, and it is a separate module because this one
 * reaches `@y/y` to rewrite a live node. A host importing the NDJSON format
 * from here would load a CRDT to concatenate strings, which is exactly the
 * boundary `format.ts` exists to state. Everything pure is re-exported below,
 * so nothing outside the package has two imports to keep straight.
