/**
 * The one WebSocket dial every browser replica makes.
 *
 * ADR-0222 left a host exactly one thing to write: how to make a socket. This
 * is that one thing, written once, because it turned out to be the same
 * everywhere: build the store route's address, hand the socket's events to the
 * driver, and say whether a rejection was a credential refusal or a transport
 * failure. Reconnecting, backoff, cursor placement, and the
 * unacknowledged-submission watchdog all stay in `createSyncConnection`, where
 * they always were.
 *
 * It lives beside the driver rather than in the app that first wrote it,
 * because the classification decides what a person is shown: a refusal is a
 * status line naming what auth needs, and anything else is a background error
 * for the log. What an application actually varies is the data id it opens.
 *
 * The credential model arrives as a `SocketTransport`, the contract
 * `@epicenter/sync` declares beside the address it is dialled with. An
 * `AuthClient` implements it, so nothing here knows what a credential is: the
 * route builds the address, and auth appends the bearer to it.
