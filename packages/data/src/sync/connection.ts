/**
 * The half of a connection that is correctness, over the half that is a socket.
 *
 * `createSyncClient` deliberately owns no socket, and that is worth keeping:
 * every timing rule in it is testable without a network, which is not a
 * hypothetical benefit here, because a cursor rule on this branch once "worked"
 * in a simulation where nothing was ever delivered. Socket CONSTRUCTION also
 * genuinely differs per host: a browser origin builds a URL and carries a
 * cookie, a desktop window carries a bearer, a lab page carries neither.
 *
 * What was not legitimate is that the rules for DRIVING that socket lived in
 * each host's own copy of a connect loop. Reconnecting when the client reports
 * `needsResync` is one of them, and it is a correctness requirement rather than
 * a nicety: a randomised schedule wedged a device at position 108 while it kept
 * receiving 118, 119 and 121 and rejecting every one, with no error surfaced
 * anywhere and the socket perfectly healthy. A rule like that cannot be
 * something each application remembers.
 *
 * So the split is: the host says HOW to make a socket, and this file says what
 * to do with one. `createSyncClient` is unchanged underneath.
 *
 * ## What this owns
 *
 * - The cursor goes into every dial, read fresh, so a reconnect is always a
 *   catch-up from what this replica has applied.
 * - Attach on open, feed on message, detach on close.
 * - Reconnect when the socket closes, with backoff.
 * - Reconnect when the client reports `needsResync`, which is the repair for a
 *   gap and for a broken chunk stream alike.
 * - Reconnect when a submission goes unacknowledged for too long. This is the
 *   cheap answer to the production stall recorded in
 *   `evidence/workerd/results.md`: a sustained run against Cloudflare stopped
 *   waiting for an acknowledgement, four hypotheses were tested and none was
 *   it. A watchdog makes it self-healing whatever the cause turns out to be,
 *   which is worth more than the diagnosis.
 * - Nudging on local work, by subscribing to the store rather than by asking
 *   every caller to remember.
 * - Reporting a credential refusal as data on the status, and dialling again
 *   on the same backoff. A refusal is decided locally, before anything reaches
 *   the wire: the host has no credential, or the one it has was already
 *   refused. So a retry capped at thirty seconds costs a status read, and the
 *   dial after a person signs back in simply succeeds. This driver runs for as
 *   long as the store is open and has no parked state to resume from.
 *
 * Everything else is ordinary weather: a close, garbage on the wire, and every
 * failure reconnect on backoff. Nothing this driver sees can discard local
 * state, which is what makes "doubt never discards" structural rather than
 * careful.
