 *
 * There is one verb, `deliver`, and it means "everything after your cursor".
 * A device returning from a week offline and a device being handed the update
 * someone typed a moment ago run the same loop with different starting numbers.
 * A second path for the live case is where a transport grows a rule that is
 * true only when it is warm.
 *
 * The log describes exactly one generation of one database, and the address
 * says which (ADR-0292). That is what deleted admission: a replica reaching
 * this hub was addressed at this generation, a generation is created once and
 * never mutated in place, so there is no history it could be holding bytes
 * from and nothing to compare. The document announcement, the bootstrap
 * round-trip, and the retirement arm all went with the question.
