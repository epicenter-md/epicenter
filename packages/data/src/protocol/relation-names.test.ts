/**

 * If a SQLite upgrade changes which keywords parse as a bare relation, this
 * fails loudly here instead of silently producing a Lens that binds fine and
 * then cannot be inspected.
 *
 * Key behaviors:
 * - The constant matches the linked SQLite exactly, in both directions
 * - Every admissible table name really does mount and select without quoting
 * - Reserved and private relation names stay unreachable from a Lens
