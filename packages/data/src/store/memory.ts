 * lands in: the desktop SPA runs in a WebView over a client-owned store
 * (ADR-0227), and the host owns no application data (ADR-0226). The file
 * opener that used to sit beside this one was deleted with the runtime it
 * served; a Bun or CLI process opening a person's store is a decision, not a
 * default, and would earn its own named opener.
 *
 * It takes the definition for the same reason every opener does, so one entry
 * point has one shape (ADR-0229). It claims no address, and that is not an
 * oversight: two memory stores that mint their own records are two independent
 * documents by construction, which is the two-devices case rather than the
 * two-handles-on-one-record case the claim exists to refuse.
