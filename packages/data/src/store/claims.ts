/**
 * Which durable documents are currently held open, in this realm and across
 * this origin.
 *
 * Two opens of one document would be two `Y.Doc`s of it that cannot see each
 * other's writes, converging through storage under last-writer-wins: work
 * disappears, converged, with no error and nothing to retry. Refusing the
 * second open makes that unreachable rather than something a caller must avoid,
 * which is the move ADR-0216 made against the chosen-id door.
 *
 * The key is the durable document's own address, which is what makes the guard
 * exact. On Bun that is the dataId, because an application folder holds one
 * document; in a browser it is
 * `epicenter/v5/<appId>/<principalId>/<dataId>/<generation>` (ADR-0324,
 * ADR-0292), so two applications naming one data id may be open at once, two
 * accounts on one device may be open at once, two generations of one database
 * may be open at once, and a second open of any of them is still refused. Two
 * accounts are held apart by the address rather than by this: they never
 * contend for one key, so a claim here is always a genuine conflict over one
 * copy.
 *
 * A lifecycle here is legitimate under ADR-0203 rather than a platform forming:
 * one file and one document with two claimants is genuinely contended. It holds
 * lock releases rather than handles, and disposing a store releases its entry.
 *
 * It used to be a module-level `Set`, and that was never enough. A `Set` is per
 * JavaScript realm, so two browser tabs of one application each got their own,
 * both claims succeeded, and the failure this module exists to prevent was
 * reachable the whole time on any origin a person can open twice.
 *
 * One mechanism, not two. An exclusive Web Lock cannot be re-granted while it
 * is held, not even to the context holding it, so it already answers the
 * same-realm case the `Set` was answering. Keeping both would be two guards
 * over one invariant, free to disagree, which is the shape this codebase has
 * been paying for elsewhere.
 *
 * It lives beside the openers rather than inside one for what it holds, not
 * for who calls it. Both callers are in `browser.ts` now, so the older reason
 * ("neither opener owns it") stopped being true when the file opener was
 * deleted (ADR-0269). What earns the file today is that it is the one place
 * assuming a platform: the Web Locks dance, declared without the DOM library,
 * paired with the polyfill a test runtime installs (`test-locks.ts`).

 *
 * A runtime with no `navigator.locks` is refused rather than let through. The
