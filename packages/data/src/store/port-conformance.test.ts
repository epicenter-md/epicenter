/**
 * One suite, both `DurablePort` implementations, identical batches.
 *
 * There are two hand-written implementations of one port: `log.ts` over SQL,
 * and `browser.ts` over IndexedDB. Until this file existed they were tested
 * separately, each against its own expectations, so both stayed green while
 * they disagreed. Every test here drives BOTH through the same
 * `DurableOp[]` and asserts the same observable result, which is the only
 * thing that can hold two implementations of one contract together.
 *
 * What "observable" means here is deliberately narrow: what a reopen loads.
 * Row counts and storage layout are not the contract; two ports may fold at
 * different moments and still be correct, so the fold test asserts REPLAYED
 * STATE rather than shape.
 *
 * A case that fails on only one side is not automatically that side's bug.
 * It is a question about which behavior the contract intends, and the answer
 * belongs in this file's expectations once it is decided.
