/**
 * Open one application's store in a browser page.
 *
 * The store runs HERE, on the main thread. The live Yjs document is the
 * source of truth, and the durable update log lives directly in IndexedDB.
 * Each record carries its authority position, so the outbox and cursor are
 * read from that same store and one flush is one atomic transaction (ADR-0238).
 * Every read a person makes
 * (`get`, `rows`, `ids`, `document`) comes from the `Y.Doc` already in
 * memory; SQL, when an application wants it, is a follower it composes over
 * this surface, so opening a store here loads no SQLite at all.
 *
 * ## Why IndexedDB owns the facts directly
 *
 * The previous shape snapshotted the whole in-memory SQLite (log, outbox,
 * cursor) into one IndexedDB checkpoint record after every commit. That
 * indirection stored one runtime's file format inside another's storage and
 * paid a whole-file write per commit. The update records now hold the only
 * durable facts, and the persistence controller's queue ordering keeps a
 * cursor from advancing before its bytes land (ADR-0238).
 *
 * y-indexeddb was considered and rejected: it exposes no public way to
 * participate in the transaction that records authority positions, and its
 * own debounce and compaction make its update store unreadable as the stable
 * log this transport needs.
 *
 * ## Why there is no worker
 *
 * There was one, holding an OPFS SQLite fed every statement, justified by a
 * derived index "coming back for free"; that was false, because such an index
 * rebuilds from the document at open regardless. What actually has to survive
 * is small: the log folds at `SNAPSHOT_FOLD_THRESHOLD` (64), the outbox is
 * coalesced before it is sent, and the cursor is one row. IndexedDB holds
 * that from the page.

/**
 * The storage generation, carried in the address rather than in the record.
 *
 * A record written under an older shape sits at a name nothing opens. It is
 * not detected and wiped: it is not addressed. That deletes the format
 * certificate, the comparison at every open, and the wipe transaction that
 * followed it, and it makes a bad migration impossible to write rather than
 * merely discouraged.
 *
 * Bumping this strands every existing record, which is the same thing the
 * format wipe always did, said out loud in the address instead of buried in
 * a table.
 *
 * `v2` is the collapse (ADR-0295). A `v1` record keyed its updates by the
 * document they belonged to and kept a `tombstones` store beside them; a
 * database is one document now, so those rows are a shape this reader cannot
 * honestly interpret. Stranding them is the answer, not a migration.
 *
 * `v3` is the owed-row collapse (ADR-0301). A `v2` local store wrote its own
 * appends with a NULL position, which now means "owed to an authority" on
 * every store kind; read under this shape those rows would be offered to a
 * sender that does not exist and would take the weaker of the two folds
 * forever. The value changed rather than the schema, which is exactly the
 * migration this address scheme exists to refuse.
 *
 * `v4` is the ownership collapse (ADR-0324). A `v3` record named the server
 * and the principal it belonged to and named no application; this shape names
 * the application and says nothing about the owner. Read under this shape a
 * `v3` record could be offered to an authority its address never scoped it to,
 * which is the one thing the address used to prevent, so those names are left
 * where they are.
 *
 * `v5` puts the principal back. A `v4` record named the application and the
 * data and said nothing about whose copy it was; this shape names the account,
 * so two people on one browser profile hold two records instead of meeting a
 * refusal over one. Read under this shape a `v4` record would be adopted by
 * whoever signed in next, which is exactly what its written-once binding
 * existed to prevent, so `v4` names are left where they are and nothing here

 *
 * **The principal is a segment, so two accounts on one device are two records

/**
 * Bring one generation into being (ADR-0293).
 *
 * `from` is a whole database state, and OMITTING it mints an empty one. That
 * is not a second code path: an empty database is what a folder with no files
 * in it reads as, so the default is the value rather than a branch. It used to
 * be a named helper in the artifact layer, `emptyDatabase`, whose own comment
 * said the name was the point; making it the default is the version where the
 * name does not have to be said.
 *
 * The split with the artifact layer is where ADR-0293's diagram puts it: the
 * CLIENT parses the folder with the application's own codecs and builds one
 * Yjs document (`readArtifact`), and this takes the state that came out and
 * gives it a number and an address. Keeping the parse outside means an opener
 * does not carry the artifact layer, and it is the same call either way.
 *
 * **The client never chooses the number.** With an account the authority
 * assigns it: the state is posted whole, stored whole, and the ledger row is
 * written last, so a generation exists if and only if it is listed. Without
 * one the device assigns it, by reading the addresses it already holds, which
 * is the same operation with the network step removed rather than a second
 * feature.
 *
 * The local write happens strictly AFTER the number is known, because the
 * address contains it. Both paths end identically, with bytes at a generation's
 * address that `openDatabase` will find as a cache hit.
 *
 * **Never retry this blindly.** If a response is lost after the authority
 * created the generation, listing and comparing the maximum answers what
 * happened: higher means the import landed and that is its number, unchanged
 * means it did not.

 * and a person forgetting their copy means all of it.
 *
 * Never called as a step in a protocol (ADR-0281). Opening does not repair
 * itself and sign-out deletes nothing. A person decides that this account's
 * copy on this device should be gone, and this is what they invoked.
 *
 * **Every generation is claimed before any is deleted, and then they go oldest
 * first.** The claim is what makes a refusal cost nothing: a generation another
 * window holds open answers `AlreadyOpen`, which names the repair, and nothing
 * is deleted. The order is what makes an interrupted delete legible. Deleting
 * is not atomic across databases, so a crash between two of them leaves the
 * rest; going oldest first means what survives is the newest, which is what the
 * person was looking at. That is not damage. A device holding some generations
 * and not others is the ordinary state of a device (ADR-0281): a stale replica
 * is not dangerous, it is somewhere else, and the next open resolves the newest
 * one held exactly as it always does.
 *
 * So there is no removal-intent record and no recovery screen. Retrying is the
 * same call, it is idempotent, and it finishes the job.
 *
 * It reaches only this storage generation's names. A record written under an
 * older address is not addressed by this prefix and is not deleted: stranded
 * bytes cost storage, and reaping them would make an upgrade the moment
 * somebody's unsynced work became unrecoverable.
