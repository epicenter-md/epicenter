/**
 * An in-process Web Locks API, for runtimes that do not ship one.
 *
 * The same move `fake-indexeddb/auto` makes and for the same reason: the store
 * guards one document against two opens with `navigator.locks`, that guard is
 * the only one it has, and a test runtime without the API would silently not
 * test it. Supplying the platform is honest; making the production code carry
 * a second mechanism so an absent platform still works is not.
 *
 * Deliberately small. Exclusive mode and `ifAvailable` are the whole of what
 * `claims.ts` asks for, so they are the whole of what this provides: a shared
 * lock mode or a waiting queue would be inventing behavior nothing here can
 * observe. Scoped to one process, which is exactly the scope a test has.
