 * The row's `content` node is here rather than behind a second verb

 * the live node before the handle hands one flat object to the caller.
 *
 * **The two halves have different lifetimes, and that is forced rather than
 * chosen.** A value is a snapshot: it was copied out of the document when you
 * read, and a later commit does not change it. The content node is a reference: it
 * IS the container in the document, so an edit through it is an edit to the
 * store, and a peer's edit shows up in it without anyone re-reading.
 *
 * Neither could be the other. Copying a `Y.Type` out would break the merge that
 * makes it worth having, and a value has nothing to reference: it is a JSON
 * value on a map, not an object. So a row is half snapshot and half handle,
 * and which half a field is, its declared kind already says.
 *
 * What keeps that liveable is that reads are cheap and reactive. `get` walks a
 * document already in memory, and `fromData` re-runs a `$derived` on any commit
 * that touches the table, so a surface re-reads rather than holding. Holding a
 * destructured value across a commit is the one way to be surprised, and it is
