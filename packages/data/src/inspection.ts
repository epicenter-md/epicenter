/**
 * Native relational inspection over one live Epicenter (ADR-0162).
 *
 * The product sentence: Home runs ordinary read-only SQLite against a live
 * Epicenter as though the selected Lens's logical tables were SQLite tables,
 * including a literal `SELECT * FROM notes`. Not a dialect, not a query builder,
 * not a subset: real SQLite, with real joins, aggregates, and expressions.
 *
 * Three decisions carry that:
 *
 * A dedicated connection. Inspection opens its own `bun:sqlite` handle on the
 * same file with `readonly: true` and never borrows the store owner's writable
 * one. Read-only at open is the write boundary, so there is no toggle to forget
 * to restore and no window where submitted SQL runs against a writable handle.
 * A connection cannot even promote itself: `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL` fails on
 * a read-only handle like any other write.
 *
 * Connection-local views. The raw relations and the friendly Lens tables are
 * `TEMP` views, which live in this connection's own `temp` schema. The owner
 * connection cannot see them, so nothing installed for inspection can redirect
 * an internal read; closing the connection discards them with no cleanup step.
 *
 * Present rows only, in the friendly views. `SELECT * FROM notes` answers "what
 * are my notes", and a tombstone is not a note. Deleted rows stay inspectable
 * through `_epicenter_rows`, where `presence` is a column and absence is the
 * honest answer rather than a hidden filter.
 *
 * What this is not: read-only stops mutation, not expense. A submitted query can
 * still be slow or scan the whole store. This is a trusted-host capability with
 * bounded results, not a sandbox for hostile SQL, and applications receive no
 * SQL at all.
 *
 * Row documents and blobs are deliberately absent from V1. Nothing here projects
 * document bytes, and the raw relations are not a complete portable artifact.
