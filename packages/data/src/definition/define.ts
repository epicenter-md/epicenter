/**
 * The two authoring calls, and the refusals that shape their parameters.
 *
 * A declaration is checked twice: here, while it is being written, and again
 * in `compile.ts` when it is parsed. The runtime half is the one that catches a
 * definition this file never saw, which is the only reason both exist.
 *
 * ONE DOOR. `defineTable` brands its return and `DataDefinition` requires the
 * brand, so every table is checked here and nowhere else. There used to be a
 * second path: a bare literal handed to `defineData`, re-checked by
 * `ValidateTable` and `ValidateDefinition`, which restated the same rules
 * through a different mechanism and could not report them as well. Both are
 * deleted. What is left validates `kv`, which is the one field map an
 * application still writes inline.
 *
 * A table's value fields are top-level keys. The reserved `content` key is the
 * only non-field key, and `id` cannot be claimed by a value.
