/**
 * @fileoverview The one place this package knows it is talking to Tauri.
 *
 * Everything above this file speaks in capabilities. Everything below it is
 * `@tauri-apps/api`, which is the host's own public transport: the same
 * `invoke` and `listen` Epicenter's generated bindings use. This package does
 * not reimplement either against `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__`, because a
 * private global is a worse contract than a published one and would go stale
 * silently.
 *
 * It does *read* that global, for exactly one purpose. `invoke` dereferences
 * `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__` when called, so its presence is precisely the
 * question "would this call reach a host". Asking it first is what turns a
 * plain browser tab from a thrown `TypeError` into a typed
 * `HostUnavailable`. The read is lazy, so a module imported before the host
 * finishes injecting the global is not permanently poisoned.
 *
 * # Three kinds of no
 *
 * A host that declines can decline in three ways, and they are told apart by
 * the shape of what comes back rather than by matching on message text:
 *
 * - **A plain string.** Tauri's access-control layer rejects with a string
 *   (`InvokeError` wrapping a JSON string) when a window may not call a
 *   command. None of the commands this package invokes report a failure that
 *   way: theirs are tagged objects. So a string means the call was never
 *   routed, which is `CapabilityUnavailable`.
 * - **A tagged object.** The command ran and reported a typed failure. It is
 *   handed back to the capability that asked for it, which knows which of its
 *   own names it maps to.
 * - **Anything else**, including an `Error` instance. Something broke that is
 *   not part of the contract. It travels as an opaque cause and each capability
 *   folds it into its own `*Failed` variant, never into an "unavailable".

 * this window and webview, on this origin, or with the permissions it found.
 * They are diagnostics for a developer, not user-facing copy, so they are not
 * localized and not formatted per platform.
 *
 * This is the conservative half of a deliberately asymmetric test. A refusal
 * whose wording changes in a future Tauri stops being reported as
 * `CapabilityUnavailable` and becomes an ordinary failure, which loses a
 * distinction. The reverse mistake would state that an app was never granted an
 * operation when it was, which is a claim someone would act on. Losing a
