/**
 * @fileoverview The one place this package knows it is talking to Tauri.
 *
 * Everything above this file speaks in capabilities. Everything below it is
 * `@tauri-apps/api`, which is the host's own public transport: the same
 * `invoke` and `listen` Epicenter's generated bindings use. This package does
 * not reimplement either against `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__`, because a
 * private global is a worse contract than a published one and would go stale
 * silently.
 *
 * It does not probe for that global. An installed app is served by an Epicenter
 * host and runs nowhere else, so the host is present by construction; a check
 * asking "is one here" could only ever answer yes, and a check that cannot fail
 * is worse than no check because it reads as protection. If the global is
 * somehow absent, `invoke` rejects and the rejection travels the ordinary path
 * below, landing in the calling capability's own `*Failed` variant with its
 * cause attached. That is the honest report: something broke, rather than a
 * claim about which environment this is.
 *
 * # Three kinds of no
 *
 * A host that declines can decline in three ways, and they are told apart by
 * the shape of what comes back rather than by matching on message text:
 *
 * - **A plain string.** Tauri serializes framework failures to strings, and one
 *   of them is its access-control layer refusing to route the call. Only that
 *   one is `CapabilityUnavailable`; see `REFUSED_MARKER` below.
 * - **A tagged object.** The command ran and reported a typed failure. It is
 *   handed back to the capability that asked for it, which knows which of its
 *   own names it maps to.
 * - **Anything else**, including an `Error` instance. Something broke that is
 *   not part of the contract. It travels as an opaque cause and each capability
 *   folds it into its own `*Failed` variant, never into an "unavailable".
 *
 * # Events are scoped to this window, never to "any"
 *
 * Subscriptions go through `getCurrentWebviewWindow().listen`, not the bare
 * `listen` from `@tauri-apps/api/event`, and the difference is isolation rather
 * than style. Bare `listen` registers the target `Any`, and Tauri's dispatcher
 * short-circuits an `Any` listener past the emit's own filter
 * (`match_any_or_filter`, `event/listener.rs`). A host that carefully emits to
 * one owner's label would still reach every app window that happened to
 * subscribe. Scoping to the current webview window registers
 * `WebviewWindow { label }`, which the emit filter matches only when the label
 * is this window's, so an app hears about its own recordings and no one
 * else's.

 * this window and webview, on this origin, or with the permissions it found.
 * They are diagnostics for a developer, not user-facing copy, so they are not
 * localized and not formatted per platform.
 *
 * This is the conservative half of a deliberately asymmetric test. A refusal
 * whose wording changes in a future Tauri stops being reported as
 * `CapabilityUnavailable` and becomes an ordinary failure, which loses a
 * distinction. The reverse mistake would state that an app was never granted an
 * operation when it was, which is a claim someone would act on. Losing a
