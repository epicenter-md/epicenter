/**
 * What `createEpicenter` decides before it acquires anything.
 *
 * The handle is inert until `open`, so what is left to check here is the two
 * things construction refuses and the one thing it records. Everything about
 * opening, closing, and erasing a replica is `client-owned-data.test.ts`, which
 * drives a real IndexedDB.
 *
 * The binding tests that used to live here left with the binding: SQLite files
 * and secrets are `@epicenter/device`, and its own tests own them.
