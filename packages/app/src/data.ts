/**
 * @fileoverview Structured data, bound through one Lens the app declares.
 *
 * An app names its own durable namespace, its tables, and its values, and binds
 * them here. Nothing about that declaration is Epicenter's to own: a Lens is
 * inert JSON vocabulary from `@epicenter/lens`, which is why two apps can
 * import the same contract module and reach the same data without either of
 * them, or the contract, depending on this client.
 *
 * # Why `bind` is asynchronous
 *
 * The rest of this package has no opener, because there is no connection behind
 * recording or transcription. Data does have one. A bound handle promises to
 * report when its data may be stale, and that promise is only keepable if the
 * observation carrier is already established when the handle is handed over. A
 * synchronous `bind` would have to open the carrier lazily, which leaves a
 * window where an app has subscribed, read, and missed a change that landed in
 * between. Awaiting the bind closes that window at the one place a caller
 * already expects to wait.
 *
 * This does not reintroduce the `openEpicenter()` that ADR-0186 refused. There
 * is still no handle-wide session, no configuration, and no connection object
 * an app holds: `bind` is per Lens, and what it waits for is the document's
 * shared observation carrier.
 *
 * # One carrier per document, however many Lenses
 *
 * A Lens is one namespace, and an app may declare several. What an app must not
 * get is one host surface, one socket, and one reconnect loop per declaration:
 * the host broadcasts every committed address to every surface, so a second
 * socket carries a second copy of the same firehose, heals its own gap on its
 * own schedule, and registers a second surface the host has to keep.
 *
 * So the carrier belongs to the document rather than to the binding. The first
 * `bind` opens it, every later `bind` joins it, and it closes when the last
	 * binding lets go. `[Symbol.asyncDispose]()` finishes the binding at the call
	 * site, where it is normally used with `await using`; its handles refuse
	 * further use and its listeners are released. Whether that was also the last
	 * one is the transport's business,
 * not the app's.
 *
 * # Reading is a re-read, never a push
 *
 * Nothing here streams row contents. Invalidation says what may be stale; the
 * app re-reads through the handle it already has. That keeps one copy of the
 * data (the host's) and leaves the app in charge of what it caches.
