/**
 * One application's Epicenter Data session: the replica it opens, and the
 * account it opens it for (ADR-0316, ADR-0339).
 *
 * An application creates `epicenter` once and reaches its data through it. It
 * never selects IndexedDB, a generation number, or a socket, because none of
 * those names appear on this surface.
 *
 * **This handle is the session and nothing else.** Device-owned SQLite files
 * and secrets are `@epicenter/device`, a separate package because they are
 * a separate kind of thing: a file is a device cache opened before anyone signs
 * in and a keychain entry is how an account is reached at all, so neither has a
 * principal to be scoped by. Keeping them here made this package vary by
 * runtime and carry a SQLite worker for three applications that never called
 * one.
 *
 * The store is client-owned in every runtime (ADR-0226, ADR-0227), so there is
 * one `createEpicenter` and it serves every build. Nothing about a session
 * varies by platform, which is why there is no seam under it and no
 * `typeof window` test: a desktop build runs in a WebView, so a runtime sniff
 * could not tell it apart from a browser tab anyway.
