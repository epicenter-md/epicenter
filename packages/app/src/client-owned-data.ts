/**
 * Opening a person's Epicenter Data, in every runtime.
 *
 * Its own module because the handle composes it rather than contains it. It
 * lived in `browser.ts` while a browser was the only caller, which left the
 * desktop leaf importing an opener from a file named for the other runtime: a
 * reader would fairly conclude the desktop build falls back to the browser
 * one, and it does not. Neither leaf reaches it now; the handle does, once,
 * because there is one opener for the same reason there was one answer.
 *
 * **The store is client-owned everywhere.** The host serves bundles and brokers
 * credentials and owns no application data (ADR-0226, ADR-0227). The desktop
 * leaf adds nothing before this call and nothing after it: a deployed app is a
 * trusted app (ADR-0334), so both leaves reach the same store the same way.

 * Open the newest generation of this definition's store, minting one when the

 *
 * The store is a replica of `account`, because an authority mints every
 * generation. The application supplies the account, since it is what knows
 * which principal it is acting as.
 *
 * `appId` is the OPENING application's, which is not the data id: it is the
 * segment of the address that keeps two applications naming one data id on
 * their own replicas (ADR-0324, ADR-0304). It comes from the handle rather than
 * from a caller, which is what the handle is for, and nothing verifies it: a
 * deployed app is a trusted app (ADR-0334).
 *
 * Two calls, and the first one is not "read the cache". `resolveGeneration`
 * asks the account which generations exist when this device holds none, so a
 * second device joins the notebook the first one made instead of minting a
 * rival. This used to create one whenever the local cache was empty, which
 * forked one account's notes into two histories on the second machine that
 * opened them.
 *
 * **What this acquires, it hands back a closer for.** Opening takes three
 * things: the document and its Web Lock, a socket, and a page-hide listener.
 * They live for one session, which is shorter than the page: the session
 * component's cleanup closes when its `{#key}` remounts or its `{#if}` flips
 * (ADR-0350). The store cannot close itself, because a store is one of the
 * three (ADR-0340).
