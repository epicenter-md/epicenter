/**
 * Server app factory. Wires the portable per-request lifecycle (origin + trust
 * resolution, CORS, CSRF) and returns a `Hono` instance the deployment mounts
 * every other sub-app on.
 *
 * It takes exactly one thing, the single axis a deployment varies on: an
 * {@link Identity}, who THIS deployment is on the web (its canonical origin and
 * the origins it trusts). That varies per deployment, NOT per runtime, so
 * `apps/api` passes the same identity whether it runs on Workers or Bun.
 *
 * Nothing else here is runtime-specific. The cloud's Postgres connection and
 * `waitUntil` drain are cloud concerns the cloud installs itself
 * ({@link mountCloudDb}), because only Better Auth and billing use them. The
 * instance composes neither.
 *
 * Generic over the context `E`: the cloud composes `createServerApp<CloudEnv>` so
 * it can add db + Better Auth state, the instance composes `createServerApp()`
 * (portable {@link Env}) and the type cannot name a cloud variable.
