/**
 * A whole database, through the real object, well past the value cap.
 *
 * ADR-0293 sends a generation's entire state as one request body and serves it
 * back the same way, and ADR-0295 sizes a database by its authority rather
 * than by its device. Both claims live or die inside `workerd`, and `bun test`
 * cannot run a Durable Object, so this is where the transfer is actually
 * exercised: 8 MB is nearly four times the enforced 2,199,995-byte SQLite value
 * cap, so it cannot pass without the authority chunking on the way in and
 * joining on the way out.
 *
 * What it catches is the failure with no smaller test: a chunking bug that
 * silently truncates a person's whole database on import or on bootstrap.
 *
 * **Compared by digest rather than by `toEqual`.** That is a measurement, not
 * a style choice. A byte-for-byte `expect(back).toEqual(state)` on two 8 MB
 * typed arrays exhausts the isolate outright ("Ineffective mark-compacts near
 * heap limit"), and it walls between 7.75 MB and 7.87 MB in this
 * configuration. The server path is not what runs out: the same 8 MB import
 * and bootstrap pass when the assertion does not hold both copies and build a
 * diff over them. A digest is exact, constant-space, and the reason this test
 * can be the size it needs to be.
