/**
 * Test-only: a replica that lives inside `workerd`, driven by the real driver.
 *
 * It is a Durable Object for one reason. A replica is an `DataDocument`, a
 * store's durable record is SQLite here, and the only synchronous SQLite
 * inside `workerd` is a Durable Object's own storage. Everything else here is
 * the deployed client: `createAccountStore` for the store, `attachStoreSync`
 * for the dial, over the real routes, so a test can assert on the rows a
 * device actually holds rather than on frames a harness counted.
 *
 * `attachStoreSync` rather than a dial written here, because a second dial
 * passes over a handshake no browser makes (ADR-0346). What this file supplies
 * is the one thing a Worker cannot borrow, a `SocketTransport` over
 * `env.SELF.fetch`, and nothing else.
 *
 * There is no adoption step and nothing to supersede. A replica is addressed at
 * one generation, a generation is created complete and never mutated in place,
 * so the address is the identity (ADR-0292): the class opens, dials, and
 * catches up, exactly as a page does.
 *
 * Not exported from `index.ts` and not in any `wrangler.jsonc`. Only the test
 * entry mounts it, so nothing deployable grows a class that exists for a test.
