/**
 * Base Vite config for SvelteKit workspace apps whose package contract and
 * browser composition live at the app root, outside `src/`.
 *
 * The `fs.allow` entry is load-bearing, but not because of Vite's own
 * default. @sveltejs/kit's plugin sets fs.allow to the app `src/`, the app and
 * workspace-root `node_modules`, and its own output, and nothing else. That
 * omits the monorepo root, so the app-root composition files (the package
 * contract and browser entry that live outside `src/`) and sibling-package
 * source are unreadable in dev. Adding the workspace root restores both; Vite
 * concatenates it with SvelteKit's entries rather than replacing them. It is
 * also what lets a worker declared inside a workspace package load at all: its
 * `new URL('./x.worker.ts', import.meta.url)` resolves to a `/@fs/` URL under
 * the monorepo root, which SvelteKit's list answers 403 to.
 *
 * **The last three are what `@epicenter/app-storage`'s browser leaf costs.**
 * Only `apps/local-mail/ui` composes it, so they belong in that app's config
 * rather than here; they stay until that move is made. Its SQLite owner is a
 * dedicated worker over `@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm`, because OPFS synchronous
 * access handles exist only in a worker context, so:
 *
 * - `optimizeDeps.exclude` keeps the package unbundled. It resolves
 *   `sqlite3.wasm` relative to its own module URL, and pre-bundling rewrites
 *   that URL into `.vite/deps/`, where no `.wasm` was copied. The fetch then
 *   falls through to the SPA fallback and the module aborts on a `text/html`
 *   response.
 * - `worker.format` makes the worker chunk ES output, which it has to be to
 *   carry that package at all.
 * - `build.target` admits the syntax that chunk uses, top-level `await`
 *   included.
 *
 * An app that needs more exclusions adds them; `mergeConfig` concatenates the
 * arrays rather than replacing them.
