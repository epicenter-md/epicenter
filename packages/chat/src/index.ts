/**
 * The canonical conversation shape every chat surface shares: the fields a
 * `conversations` table declares, the id vocabulary, its content codec, and the
 * adapter that presents one conversation's message field as the agent loop's
 * store.
 *
 * Inert, and deliberately so. Nothing here opens a document, mints an address,
 * or knows which document a conversation lives in. An application splices
 * {@link conversationsTable} into its own workspace under its own id,
 * opens its own database document (device or account, ADR-0233), and hands the row's
 * `content` node to {@link createAgentMessageStore}. Vocab has always worked this
 * way and said so; the `chatLens` that used to sit beside the table was a
 * declaration no application ever bound, kept alive by its own test, and a
 * standalone declaration is a standalone document, which is exactly what a
 * sub-feature of an application must not be.

 * through the runtime would say this module builds its schema out of a SQLite
 * projection, which it never does.
 *
 * Both stay runtime dependencies. This package publishes raw TypeScript
 * (`exports` is `./src/index.ts`, with no build and no declaration emit), so a
 * consumer compiles these very lines, and a type-only import it cannot resolve
 * is as fatal as a value one.
