/**
 * The authenticated principal id, and the partition key everything derives from.
 *
 * This is the whole package, and it is a package because `@epicenter/data` and
 * `@epicenter/auth` both need it and neither depends on the other: the store
 * opens a local database with no auth at all (`openLocal`), and the auth client
 * runs with no store (the hosted dashboard). A leaf is what two siblings share.
 *
 * On hosted Cloud, this is the principal Better Auth resolved for the request.
 * On a self-hosted instance, this is the literal {@link INSTANCE_PRINCIPAL_ID}.
 * By definition, every server path, R2 key, Durable Object name, local database
 * name, and HKDF derivation label uses this value as the partition key.
 *
 * The instance constant's bytes are pinned. Changing them changes HKDF labels,
 * R2 prefixes, Durable Object names, and IndexedDB keys.
 *
 * The type is declared first and the validator is annotated to it, so the brand
 * is written once and the schema conforms to it rather than the reverse. Both
 * carry one PascalCase name. Use {@link PrincipalId} directly inside schemas
 * (`principalId: PrincipalId`); at trusted call sites brand a known `string`
 * via {@link asPrincipalId}.
