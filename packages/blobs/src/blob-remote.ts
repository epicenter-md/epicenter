/**
 * @fileoverview The optional remote copy contract.
 *
 * A remote copies whole objects between the canonical local store and one
 * remote destination, under the same {@link BlobId}, only when explicitly
 * asked (a user action or a one-shot auto-upload policy). Bytes never pass
 * through the app caller. Browser implementations may compose over a portable
 * `BlobStore`; desktop implementations are host-owned so they can stream
 * directly from the filesystem rather than materializing recordings in the
 * WebView.
 *
 * Every operation is one-shot. There is deliberately no background sync, no
 * eager download, no retry queue, and no persisted upload-failure state: a
 * failed copy is a returned `Err` the caller acts on now or drops.
