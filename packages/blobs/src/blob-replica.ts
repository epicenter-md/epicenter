/**
 * @fileoverview The optional remote replica contract.
 *
 * A replica copies whole objects between the canonical local store and one
 * remote, under the same {@link BlobId}, only when explicitly asked (a user
 * action or a one-shot auto-upload policy). Bytes never pass through the app
 * caller. Browser implementations may compose over a portable `Blobs` store;
 * desktop implementations are host-owned so they can stream directly from
 * the filesystem rather than materializing recordings in the WebView.
 *
 * Every operation is one-shot. There is deliberately no background sync, no
 * eager download, no retry queue, and no persisted upload-failure state: a
 * failed copy is a returned `Err` the caller acts on now or drops.
