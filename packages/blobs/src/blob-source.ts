/**
 * @fileoverview The portable playback-source contract.
 *
 * A source turns a {@link BlobId} into a URL a media element (or download)
 * can consume right now, on this platform. It is a sibling capability beside
 * the byte store, not a method on `BlobStore`: bytes are portable, URLs are
 * not.
 *
 * Every source is a standard `Disposable`. The contract promises that release
 * is always safe and idempotent, not that every implementation allocates a
 * revocable resource: the browser implementation revokes its object URL
 * exactly once, while a desktop WebView source points at a stable
 * same-origin route and its disposer is a harmless no-op. Callers release
 * unconditionally (`using` in bounded scopes, a manual `[Symbol.dispose]()`
 * in component teardown) and substitution holds across platforms.
