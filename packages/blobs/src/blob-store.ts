/**
 * @fileoverview The canonical local blob store contract.
 *
 * The local store is where app operations read and write bytes; the remote
 * (see `blob-remote.ts`) is an optional, explicit copy target. Both are
 * address-only: they act on a {@link BlobId} the application already knows
 * and never enumerate ids or reconstruct application state. Application data
 * (a recording row, a document citation) supplies each id's meaning.
 *
 * Deliberately absent, so implementations cannot grow them by accident:
 * - `list`/`clear`: blob capabilities are address-only. Bulk operations
 *   iterate the ids the application's own data knows about.
 * - local `copy`: without a live caller, independent lifetime is the ordinary
 *   `get(existingId)` + `put(generateBlobId(), blob)` composition.
