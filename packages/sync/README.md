# @epicenter/sync

`@epicenter/sync` is becoming the Yjs 14-only wire and provider core for lazy
row documents. Each currently open row document uses one connection; its
structured `(table, rowId)` address belongs to the authenticated route rather
than every protocol frame.

> Transition status: the package still contains Yjs 13 per-room framing. That
> code is precedent for encoding and awareness behavior only. ADRs 0145 and
> 0146 do not preserve its peer dependency, arbitrary room ids, route shape,
> persisted format, or wire compatibility.

## Proposed destination

The final protocol is scoped to one authenticated row document:

```txt
/api/workspaces/:workspaceId/tables/:table/rows/:rowId/document
  sync-request(stateVector)
  sync-response(missingUpdate)
  update(incrementalUpdate)
```

Clients do not choose an arbitrary room id. The server authenticates the
upgrade credential, authorizes the principal for the route workspace, and uses
the returned canonical workspace key to select one authority. The remaining
route segments select one row document inside it. That structured address is
lifecycle identity, not a secret. Connection lifecycle uses reserved WebSocket
close codes rather than binary control frames. An unknown row may be accepted
only transiently so a browser can observe its retryable close code; it is never
attached to the authority or retained. Tombstoned and oversized documents close
terminally while the client keeps its durable local content.

The exact selected `epicenter-document-v3` WebSocket subprotocol owns the major.
Each binary message begins with one frame-kind byte; WebSocket already preserves
message boundaries, so the wire repeats neither a major nor a payload length.
The protocol has no document address, subscribe, unsubscribe, presence,
lifecycle control, or multiplex frame. Both peers send a state-vector request
and answer the other's request, so preexisting offline content converges in both
directions before incremental updates continue.

On Cloudflare, the authority serializes the socket's one fixed address in its
hibernation attachment together with the selected document major. A restored
socket verifies that major before parsing a frame. The authority accepts the
socket with one deterministic hashed address tag. Fanout queries that tag, then
compares each complete attachment address before sending. This avoids a durable
multiplex subscription set and makes a tag collision harmless. Reconnect
repeats the route and state-vector exchange.

The package targets only `@y/y` 14. It will expose the document wire vocabulary,
Yjs 14 sync encoding and the provider behavior needed by
`RowDocument`. It will not expose scalar row sync, SQLite storage, multiplexed
subscription recovery, per-room authority ownership, or a generic user-selected
room service.

Browser and native clients share provider semantics without sharing storage:

```txt
RowDocument
  local persistence          workspace IndexedDB log | native SQLite log
  network                    one WebSocket while this document is open
  durability                 invocation-time local update cut
  connection                 reactive per-document status
```

Local persistence replays Yjs 14 updates, appends every observed update,
compacts at bounded thresholds, and fails closed on corruption or eviction.
Remote settlement is deliberately absent until a concrete workflow earns it.

## Current Yjs 13 implementation

### Installation

Inside this monorepo:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@epicenter/sync": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

The current package has a peer dependency on `yjs`. The destination removes it
in favor of the repository's pinned `@y/y` 14 line.

### Quick usage

The core flow is small on purpose: encode a sync message, send it over whatever transport you want, then decode or handle it on the other side.

```typescript
import * as Y from "yjs";
import {
  MESSAGE_TYPE,
  SYNC_MESSAGE_TYPE,
  decodeMessageType,
  decodeSyncMessage,
  encodeSyncStep1,
  handleSyncPayload,
} from "@epicenter/sync";

const doc = new Y.Doc();
doc.getMap("users").set("alice", { name: "Alice", age: 30 });

const step1 = encodeSyncStep1({ doc });
const messageType = decodeMessageType(step1);

if (messageType === MESSAGE_TYPE.SYNC) {
  const decoded = decodeSyncMessage(step1);

  if (decoded.type === "step1") {
    const response = handleSyncPayload({
      syncType: SYNC_MESSAGE_TYPE.STEP1,
      payload: decoded.stateVector,
      doc,
      origin: null,
    });

    // send response over WebSocket, HTTP, BroadcastChannel, or anything else
  }
}
```

That example is the same shape used in the package tests and in the API room bootstrap, where the server starts a connection with `encodeSyncStep1({ doc })`.

### Current framing boundary

This package is strict about one boundary: it handles protocol framing, not connection management. That split is why the same message helpers work over WebSockets, BroadcastChannel, or any custom relay you want to write.

The design shows up in a few places:

- `encodeSyncStep1`, `encodeSyncStep2`, and `encodeSyncUpdate` only deal with Yjs payloads.
- RPC framing is separate from RPC behavior. The package defines request/response bytes and shared error variants, not the transport policy around retries or timeouts.

If you want lifecycle helpers for a WebSocket server, this package is the protocol layer under them. Not the server itself.

### Current API overview

Main exports from `src/index.ts`:

- Message constants: `MESSAGE_TYPE`, `SYNC_MESSAGE_TYPE`, `RPC_TYPE`
- Sync encode/decode: `encodeSyncStep1`, `encodeSyncStep2`, `encodeSyncUpdate`, `decodeSyncMessage`, `handleSyncPayload`
- Awareness helpers: `encodeAwareness`, `encodeAwarenessStates`, `encodeQueryAwareness`
- RPC helpers: `encodeRpcRequest`, `encodeRpcResponse`, `decodeRpcMessage`, `decodeRpcPayload`
- RPC types and guards: `DecodedRpcMessage`, `RpcError`, `isRpcError`

The package exports pure functions. Feed them bytes and docs; they give you bytes or decoded shapes back.

## Destination relationship to other packages

`@epicenter/sync` sits below the rest of the sync stack.

```text
workspace authority     liveness, snapshots, logs, WebSocket lifecycle
        │
@epicenter/workspace    restricted lazy RowDocument API and runtime persistence
        │
@epicenter/sync         single-document wire and provider behavior
        │
@y/y 14                 CRDT state, awareness, and update encoding
```

In practice:

- The workspace authority uses it to serve each open row document through its
  own connection while retaining one durable workspace owner.
- `@epicenter/workspace` uses it behind the restricted `RowDocument` handle.
- `@epicenter/data` never imports it; scalar convergence is a separate
  protocol plane.
- Other packages need the wire format only when implementing a document
  transport or provider.

## License

MIT. `@epicenter/sync` is wire-protocol vocabulary in the developer toolkit (code you build with), so it is MIT like the rest of the toolkit. That matches the package manifest.
