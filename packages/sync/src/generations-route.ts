/**
 * The generations collection: where a database's history is listed, created,
 * and fetched (ADR-0292, ADR-0293).
 *
 * It lives beside `store-route.ts` and for the same reason: both halves need
 * the path and only one of them is a server. A page building a bootstrap URL
 * has no business importing Hono to learn what to ask for.
 *
 * Three verbs over one collection, and the sync socket is deliberately not one
 * of them. HTTP carries getting a complete copy, which is parallel, resumable,
 * cacheable, and needs no protocol; the socket carries what is being edited.
 *
 * ```txt
 *  GET  /api/data/v1/<dataId>/generations       the numbers that exist
 *  POST /api/data/v1/<dataId>/generations       import: body is one whole state
 *  GET  /api/data/v1/<dataId>/generations/<n>   that generation's bytes
 * ```
 *
 * WHOSE data it is comes from the resolved bearer, server-side, and is never in
 * the path, so there is no value a client can write here that reaches another
 * partition (ADR-0092).

/**
 * The log position the served bytes are current through.
 *
 * What makes a bootstrap worth making. Without it a device would seed a cursor
 * of zero, dial, and be handed the authority's snapshot, which is the same
 * state it just downloaded over HTTP; with it the socket carries only what
 * happened afterwards. It is a header rather than a wrapper around the body
 * because the body is stored whole and served verbatim, and anything that
 * framed it would have to be unframed on both sides.
