/**
 * The desktop binding: the trusted Epicenter origin is the owner, reached over
 * same-origin HTTP.
 *
 * Two capabilities, and neither of them is the store. **Data stays
 * client-owned, and the host contributes nothing to it.** The store lives in
 * the WebView, exactly as it does in a browser tab, because the host serves
 * bundles and brokers credentials and owns no application data (ADR-0226,
 * ADR-0227). It is not on this leaf at all (ADR-0339): a deployed app is a
 * trusted app (ADR-0334), so there was no admission round trip and no second
 * party whose answer could mean anything, and a seam with one implementation
 * is not a seam.
 *
 * **This leaf builds storage, not a data session.** Nothing about a session
 * varies by runtime; the trusted owner's files and keychain do. So this is what
 * an application selects per build, while one `createEpicenter` in
 * `@epicenter/app` serves every build.
 *
 * **SQLite is a Bun-owned file.** The owner maps `(appId, name)` to a path
 * below the one Epicenter data root; the application sends statements and never
 * sees the path. Deleting one is the same round trip, and the owner closes its
 * handle before it unlinks, because the application cannot (ADR-0321).
 *
 * **A secret is a keychain entry.** The owner hands it to Rust over the private
 * sidecar pipe, which is the only thing on this machine that names a keyring
 * entry. Nothing durable lands in the page.
