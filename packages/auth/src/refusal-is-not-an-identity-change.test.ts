/**
 * A refused credential must never look like a different person.
 *
 * This is the one cross-client invariant that keeps an application from
 * thrashing its own session, and it is not obvious from any single client's
 * code, which is why it is stated once here rather than three times in three
 * files.
 *
 * ## The loop it prevents
 *
 * A boot node keys one session on the principal, which is `null` when signed
 * out and `state.principalId` otherwise (ADR-0350). Every client boots
 * OPTIMISTICALLY: it reports the identity it can prove from disk and verifies
 * over the network afterwards. So if a refusal writes `signed-out`, the
 * sequence is
 *
 *   boot optimistic -> verify -> refused -> signed-out -> GATE FLIPS -> boot optimistic
 *
 * and the application spins at one verification round trip forever, on any
 * device whose stored credential has gone bad, closing and reopening a store
 * each time round.
 *
 * The gate used to be `reloadOnAuthChange`, which replaced the whole document
 * and is now deleted. The invariant outlived it, which is the point of stating
 * it against `principalKey` rather than against whatever reads it: the same
 * flip now remounts a `{#key}` instead, and remounting is what a refusal must
 * never cause, because it is the transition that fires spontaneously and would
 * interrupt someone mid-keystroke.
 *
 * This shipped. `createInstanceTokenAuth` wrote `signed-out` on a refused
 * instance token, so a self-hosted box whose `INSTANCE_TOKEN` had been rotated
 * spun on every load (fixed in `5664edbc`). The hosted client never had the bug
 * because it routes a refusal to `reauth-required`, which keeps the principal.
 *
 * ## What is asserted
 *
 * Not "the state is X" for each client, which is what the per-client suites
 * already do and what let the loop through: each of them was individually
 * correct about its own client. The assertion here is the relationship a gate
 * actually reads, `principalKey` before versus after a refusal, so a future
 * client that invents a fourth state still has to satisfy it, and so the
 * invariant survived the gate being replaced.
 *
 * The cookie client is the interesting exemption and is asserted as one: it
 * genuinely learns its identity over the network, because an httpOnly cookie is
 * invisible to JavaScript, so `signed-out -> signed-in` is a real discovery
 * rather than a refusal. It is safe today only because `apps/api/ui` mounts no
 * reload gate, and that is a fact worth failing a test over if anyone ever
 * mounts one there.
