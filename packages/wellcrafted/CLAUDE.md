# Standard Workflow
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to specs/[feature-name].md where [feature-name] is the name of the feature.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the projectplan.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.


# Human-Readable Control Flow
When refactoring complex control flow, mirror natural human reasoning patterns:

1. **Ask the human question first**: "Can I use what I already have?" → early return for happy path
2. **Assess the situation**: "What's my current state and what do I need to do?" → clear, mutually exclusive conditions  
3. **Take action**: "Get what I need" → consolidated logic at the end
4. **Use natural language variables**: `canReuseCurrentSession`, `isSameSettings`, `hasNoSession` - names that read like thoughts
5. **Avoid artificial constructs**: No nested conditions that don't match how humans actually think through problems

Transform this: nested conditionals with duplicated logic
Into this: linear flow that mirrors human decision-making

# Style
- Always use `type = ` instead of `interface` in Typescript.
