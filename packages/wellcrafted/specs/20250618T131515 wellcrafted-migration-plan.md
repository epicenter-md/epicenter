# Migration Plan: @epicenterhq/result → wellcrafted

## Overview
Transform the current `@epicenterhq/result` library into `wellcrafted` - delightful TypeScript utilities that make code elegant and type-safe. This plan outlines all necessary changes to rebrand and expand the library's scope while maintaining backward compatibility where possible.

## Brand Identity & Energy

The `wellcrafted` brand embodies:
- **Delightful Experience**: APIs that spark joy and make coding feel effortless
- **Polished & Elegant**: Refined design that feels thoughtful and sophisticated
- **Type-Safe Excellence**: Careful approach to error handling and type safety
- **Thoughtful Engineering**: Deliberate choices that prioritize developer experience
- **Professional Quality**: Short, memorable, and unmistakably high-quality
- **Well-Crafted Patterns**: Artisanal attention to TypeScript best practices

**Tagline:** "Delightful TypeScript utilities for elegant, type-safe applications."

## Goals
- [x] Research current usage in production (whispering project - no dependencies found)
- [ ] Rename package from `@epicenterhq/result` to `wellcrafted`
- [ ] Update all documentation to reflect new brand positioning
- [ ] Expand scope from "result library" to "delightful TypeScript utilities"
- [ ] Maintain all existing functionality
- [ ] Update internal references and branding

## Phase 1: Core Package Changes

### 1.1 Package Metadata
- [ ] Update `package.json` name from `@epicenterhq/result` to `wellcrafted`
- [ ] Update description to: "Delightful TypeScript utilities for elegant, type-safe applications"
- [ ] Update keywords to include: `typescript`, `delightful`, `elegant`, `type-safe`, `well-crafted`, `polished`, `utilities`, `result`, `error-handling`, `brand-types`
- [ ] Verify version strategy (current: 0.15.0)

### 1.2 Internal Branding Updates
- [ ] Update brand symbol in `src/brand.ts` (already shows "wellcrafted/brand")
- [ ] Review all internal comments and references
- [ ] Update any internal naming that references the old package

## Phase 2: Documentation Updates

### 2.1 README.md (Root)
- [ ] Update title from "A Modern Approach to Error Handling in TypeScript" to "wellcrafted"
- [ ] Update subtitle to emphasize broader utility collection
- [ ] Update npm badges to use `wellcrafted` package name
- [ ] Update installation instructions: `npm install wellcrafted`
- [ ] Update import examples: `import { ... } from "wellcrafted"`
- [ ] Add new positioning statement about delightful TypeScript utilities
- [ ] Update design philosophy section to reflect broader scope

### 2.2 src/README.md
- [ ] Update title from "Result" to "wellcrafted utilities"
- [ ] Expand overview to cover all utilities (Result, Brand types, etc.)
- [ ] Update examples to use `wellcrafted` imports
- [ ] Add sections for non-Result utilities if they exist

### 2.3 Additional Documentation Files
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md to reflect the rebrand
- [ ] Update CHANGESET_GUIDE.md if it references the old name
- [ ] Update ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE.md imports and references
- [ ] Update NAMING_CONVENTION.md if it has package references
- [ ] Update SERVICES_GUIDE.md if it references the package

## Phase 3: Code Structure & Exports

### 3.1 Current Module Structure
```
src/
├── index.ts          # Main exports
├── result.ts         # Result type and utilities
├── utils.ts          # General utilities
├── brand.ts          # Brand type utilities
└── error/
    ├── types.ts      # Error type definitions
    └── utils.ts      # Error utilities
```

### 3.2 Export Strategy
- [ ] Maintain all current exports from `src/index.ts`
- [ ] Ensure Result utilities remain primary export
- [ ] Consider organizing exports by category:
  - Result handling (Ok, Err, isOk, isErr, trySync, tryAsync)
  - Error utilities (TaggedError, extractErrorMessage)
  - Brand types (Brand symbol and utilities)
  - General utilities

### 3.3 New Utility Additions (Future)
- [ ] Consider what other "delightful" utilities could be added
- [ ] Plan module structure for future additions
- [ ] Ensure tree-shaking compatibility is maintained

## Phase 4: Build & Distribution

### 4.1 Build Configuration
- [ ] Update `tsdown.config.ts` if it contains package references
- [ ] Verify `tsconfig.json` doesn't need updates
- [ ] Test build process with new package name
- [ ] Verify generated `.d.ts` files are correct

### 4.2 Distribution Strategy
- [ ] Plan npm publishing approach
- [ ] Consider deprecation notice for old package
- [ ] Coordinate with existing consumers (if any)

## Phase 5: Examples & Testing

### 5.1 Examples Directory
- [ ] Update any examples in `examples/` directory
- [ ] Update import statements to use `wellcrafted`
- [ ] Verify all examples still work correctly

### 5.2 Testing Strategy
- [ ] Add tests if they don't exist
- [ ] Verify all functionality works after rename
- [ ] Test import/export paths

## Phase 6: Publishing & Migration

### 6.1 Pre-Publication Checklist
- [ ] All internal references updated
- [ ] All documentation updated
- [ ] Build process verified
- [ ] Examples tested
- [ ] Version number decided

### 6.2 Publication Strategy
- [ ] Publish `wellcrafted@0.15.0` (or appropriate version)
- [ ] Consider publishing a migration guide
- [ ] Update any external references

### 6.3 Old Package Deprecation
- [ ] Add deprecation notice to `@epicenterhq/result`
- [ ] Point users to `wellcrafted` in deprecation message
- [ ] Consider timeline for maintaining old package

## Implementation Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing APIs will remain exactly the same
- Only package name and branding changes
- Existing consumers can migrate by changing import source only

### New Positioning
- Position as "delightful TypeScript utilities" rather than just Result library
- Emphasize elegant, type-safe patterns
- Maintain focus on lightweight, zero-dependency approach
- Keep serialization-first philosophy

### Future Expansion Opportunities
- Additional type utilities beyond Brand
- More async/error handling patterns  
- Validation utilities
- Functional programming helpers
- Always maintain tree-shaking and lightweight principles

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Package successfully renamed and published
- [ ] All documentation reflects new branding
- [ ] Existing functionality 100% preserved
- [ ] Build and distribution process working
- [ ] Ready for production use under new name
- [ ] Clear migration path for existing users
