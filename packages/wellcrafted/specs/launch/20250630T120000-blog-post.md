# Well Crafted: Type-Safe Error Handling for the Rest of Us

Two years ago, I dove deep into Effect-TS. I was excited by its promise of bulletproof type safety and composable error handling. But after using it in production, I found myself fighting the framework more than building features.

Don't get me wrong - Effect is brilliant. Its ideas around Result types, tagged errors, and dependency injection are game-changing. But the execution? Generator functions everywhere, a completely new execution model, and a learning curve that had my team questioning whether we were still writing TypeScript.

So I built Well Crafted: a library that takes Effect's best ideas and implements them with the JavaScript you already know.

## The Problem We're Solving

```typescript
// This looks fine... until it throws at 3am
async function getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
  const data = await response.json(); // What if this fails?
  return data; // What if data isn't a User?
}
```

JavaScript's `try/catch` has two fatal flaws:
1. **Invisible errors**: Function signatures lie about what can go wrong
2. **Non-serializable**: Error objects break across boundaries (workers, IPC, network)

## The Well Crafted Way

```typescript
import { tryAsync, type TaggedError } from "wellcrafted";

type ApiError = TaggedError<"ApiError">;

async function getUser(id: string): Promise<Result<User, ApiError>> {
  return tryAsync<User, ApiError>({
    try: async () => {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
      return response.json();
    },
    mapErr: (error) => Err({
      name: "ApiError",
      message: "Failed to fetch user",
      context: { userId: id },
      cause: error
    })
  });
}

// Usage feels like Supabase or Astro Actions
const { data, error } = await getUser("123");
if (error) {
  console.error(`${error.name}: ${error.message}`, error.context);
  return;
}
// TypeScript knows data is User here
```

## Why Not Effect?

Effect is powerful, but it asks you to rewrite your entire application:

```typescript
// Effect's approach
function* getUser(id: string) {
  const response = yield* Effect.tryPromise({
    try: () => fetch(`/api/users/${id}`),
    catch: () => new NetworkError()
  });
  // ... more generator syntax
}
```

Well Crafted keeps it simple:
- ✅ Still uses `async/await`
- ✅ Familiar `{ data, error }` destructuring
- ✅ Zero dependencies
- ✅ 4KB minified
- ✅ Incremental adoption

## Real-World Ready

Our errors are plain objects that serialize perfectly:

```typescript
type ValidationError = TaggedError<"ValidationError">;

// Works across workers, IPC, network requests
const error: ValidationError = {
  name: "ValidationError",
  message: "Email must contain @",
  context: { field: "email", value: input },
  cause: undefined
};

// Pattern match on error types
switch (error.name) {
  case "ValidationError":
    // TypeScript narrows the type
    showFieldError(error.context.field);
    break;
  case "NetworkError":
    retryWithBackoff();
    break;
}
```

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install wellcrafted
```

That's it. No configuration, no setup, just import and use.

## The Philosophy

Well Crafted is built on a simple belief: **the best abstraction is the one your team will actually use**.

We took inspiration from Effect's groundbreaking ideas but implemented them with pragmatism:
- Result types? Yes, but with familiar syntax
- Tagged errors? Yes, but as serializable objects
- Type safety? Yes, but without the learning cliff

Because great software is well crafted, not over-engineered.
