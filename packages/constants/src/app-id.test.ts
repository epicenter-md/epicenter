/**
 * What the app id grammar admits, and the question it now answers with a

 * state: that reverse domain is REQUIRED, not merely what every first-party id
 * happens to look like. Nothing else can keep that true, because every id in
 * the repository already satisfies it, so a validator loosened back to bare
 * labels would pass every other check here.
