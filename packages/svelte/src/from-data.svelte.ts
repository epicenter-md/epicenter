/**
 * A Svelte 5 reactivity adapter over one opened data handle's declared shape.
 *
 * `fromData(data)` mirrors the declaration exactly: `tables.<name>` and `kv`,
 * with the names and row types the definition declares, plus `persistence`.
 * Same verbs, same types, same names. Every read is reactive and every write
 * passes through unchanged.
 *
 * **A table is held. Everything else is read through.** A row is CRDT structs
 * until somebody builds a plain object out of it, and building one costs about
 * two microseconds, so reading ten thousand of them to learn that one moved
 * costs twenty milliseconds. A table is therefore a live projection keyed by
 * row id: seeded when this is called, patched with the ids each commit names,
 * read from thereafter. `kv` is ten keys and `persistence` is one enum, so
 * both stay read-through. The rule is "hold what is expensive to rebuild", and
 * it says no twice as often as it says yes.
 *
 * **A `SvelteMap` IS the signal for a table.** Reading one key tracks that
 * key; iterating tracks all of them. So a list wakes on any change and a
 * component reading one row wakes only for that row, with no signal in the
 * store beyond the ids it already had. `kv` and `persistence` use
 * `createSubscriber` instead, because there is nothing keyed to track.
 *
 * **A row's `content` node is not made reactive here, deliberately.** It
 * carries its own field-scoped `subscribe` (ADR-0296): an editor binds the
 * type directly and hears every keystroke without a table signal in the path.
 * `fromSubscription` is how an application reads a value off one.
 *
 * **Eager, because it cannot be lazy.** An application reads `rows` inside
 * `$derived`, and writing Svelte state from there is `state_unsafe_mutation`,
 * so a projection filled on first read is not available. `fromData` walks each
 * declared table once when it is called.
 *
 * **Never torn down.** Ref-counting a projection to its readers leaves the
 * object alive and the updates stopped, which serves the next reader rows from
 * before it looked away. Stale is worse than absent, so the subscription is
 * held for the life of the wrapper and dies with the document it mirrors.
 * There is nothing to dispose: the raw runtime still owns opening, sync
 * attachment, and disposal, and network operations stay on the raw plane on
 * purpose, because a reactive wrapper must not pretend a reconnect is local
 * state.
 *
 * One instance per opened store, made by `fromEpicenter` on the way to its
 * `ready` state, so an application never calls this itself and never calls it
 * twice. A module-global instance is correct here and used to be refused by
 * this comment: a page lifetime is one auth generation (ADR-0088), so a module
 * lifetime is one too, and the next generation is the next document.
 *
 * @example
 * ```svelte
 * <script lang="ts">
 *   const honeycrisp = fromData(data);
 *   const notes = honeycrisp.tables.notes;
 *   const active = $derived(notes.rows.filter((n) => n.deletedAt === null));
 * </script>
 * <button onclick={() => notes.create({ title: '' })}>New</button>
 * {#each active as note (note.id)}...{/each}
 * ```

/**
 * One table, held as a live projection of its rows.
 *
 * A row is CRDT structs until somebody builds a plain object out of it, and
 * building one costs about two microseconds. Reading `rows` builds every one
 * of them, so a list over ten thousand notes pays twenty milliseconds to
 * discover that one note moved. This holds what it built and rebuilds only
 * what the commit named.
 *
 * **Seeded here, never during a read.** An application reads `rows` inside
 * `$derived`, and writing Svelte state from there is `state_unsafe_mutation`.
 * Filling the map lazily on first read is therefore not available, which is
 * why this is eager and why `fromData` is no longer free to call.
 *
 * **Never torn down.** The subscription is held for the life of the wrapper
 * rather than ref-counted to readers, because a projection that stops being
 * maintained is stale rather than free: the object survives, the updates stop,
 * and the next reader is served rows from before it looked away. It dies with
 * the document it mirrors, which is the only lifetime that fits a cache.
 *
 * A `SvelteMap` rather than a plain one, and that is the reactivity: reading a
 * key tracks that key, iterating tracks all of them, so a list wakes on any
 * change while a component reading one row wakes only for that row. Nothing
 * here calls `createSubscriber`; the map IS the signal.
 *
 * **`nonconforming` is held beside `rows`, not passed through.** It used to
 * be forwarded as the handle's own getter, which reads CRDT state and touches
 * no signal, so a `$derived` over it was computed once at mount and never
 * again. That was survivable while the only reader was an empty-state count.
 * It is not survivable now: a push from the folder validates nothing
 * (ADR-0338), so an ordinary edit moves a row between the two sets and both
 * are on screen. One commit, one handler, both maps.
 *
 * The second map is filled only from the commits that empty a row out of
 * `rows`, and it conforms the table once per such commit rather than once per
 * id. A row leaving the readable projection is the rare case: a delete, or an
 * edit that broke it.
