# @epicenter/svelte

Svelte utilities for synchronizing state with external systems.

## Overview

This package provides utilities that help synchronize Svelte state with external data sources like local storage, remote APIs, or other browser APIs. These utilities handle the complexity of keeping state in sync across multiple sources while maintaining Svelte's reactive paradigm.

## Installation

This package is part of the Epicenter monorepo and is used internally. To use it in your app:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@epicenter/svelte": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

## Available Utilities

### `fromData`

Adapts one opened `@epicenter/data` handle into Svelte reactivity, mirroring
the declaration: `tables.<name>`, `kv`, and `persistence`, with the same verbs
and the same types. Reads are reactive; writes pass through unchanged.

A table is HELD as a `SvelteMap` projection keyed by row id, seeded when
`fromData` is called and patched with the row ids each commit names, because
building a row out of CRDT structs costs about two microseconds and rebuilding
ten thousand of them per keystroke does not. `kv` and `persistence` stay
read-through: ten keys and one enum are not worth holding.

Nothing is disposed by hand. The projection and its subscription live as long
as the document they mirror, deliberately: one detached from its source stays
alive and stops being true.

```ts
const app = fromData(data);
const active = $derived(app.tables.notes.rows.filter((n) => !n.deletedAt));
const note = app.tables.notes.get(id);   // wakes only when THAT row moves
app.persistence.get() === 'blocked';     // this device stopped saving
```

### `fromEpicenter`

Adapts one `@epicenter/app` handle's store into four states a route renders
from: `signed-out`, `opening`, `ready` (carrying the data), and `failed`
(carrying the error). The store is a field on the `ready` variant, so a read
before it is open does not compile.

Signed-out is answered from one read of `account.state` BEFORE anything opens,
so a person who cannot open anything pays no Web Lock, no IndexedDB, and no
round trip. It is its own state rather than a failure: folding it into the
error channel would make the gate sniff an error to choose between "sign in"
and "something broke".

Both halves are lazy, so nothing opens until something renders: the first read
of `state` starts the open and writes no signal synchronously. That makes it
safe inside a `$derived` and safe at module scope, which is where it belongs —
one call site by construction, so there is no wrapper to own and nothing to
memoize.

`eraseReplica` rides on `failed` and nowhere else. Erasing takes the same claim
an open takes, so erasing an open store is refused by the store; a failed open
released its claim before it returned.

The handle is taken structurally, the way `fromData` takes opened data, so this
package does not depend on `@epicenter/app`.

```ts
// apps/<app>/src/lib/platform/epicenter.browser.svelte.ts
export const notes = fromEpicenter(createEpicenter({ definition, account: auth }));
```

```svelte
{#if notes.state.status === 'signed-out'}
  <SignInGate />
{:else if notes.state.status === 'opening'}
  <Loading />
{:else if notes.state.status === 'ready'}
  <Notes data={notes.state.data} />
{:else}
  <BootFailure error={notes.state.error} erase={notes.state.eraseReplica} />
{/if}
```

### `fromSubscription`

One value read through a subscription, kept fresh. The four lines every
adapter in this repo used to write by hand, written once, so the announce
cannot be forgotten: forget it and the value stays correct and never updates
again.

```ts
const preview = fromSubscription(
  (update) => table.watch(body, update),
  () => notePreview(body),
);
preview.current;
```

### `createPersistedState`

Creates a persisted state object tied to local storage, accessible through `.value`. This utility ensures your state survives page refreshes and synchronizes across browser tabs.

#### Features

- **Synchronous initialization**: Immediate access to a valid value
- **Automatic validation**: Uses the provided schema to validate stored data
- **Cross-tab synchronization**: Syncs state across browser tabs via storage events
- **Graceful error recovery**: Falls back to defaults via `onParseError` handler
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with inferred types

#### Usage

```typescript
import { createPersistedState } from '@epicenter/svelte';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Define your schema
const settingsSchema = z.object({
  theme: z.enum(['light', 'dark']),
  notifications: z.boolean()
});

// Create persisted state
const settings = createPersistedState({
  key: 'app-settings',
  schema: settingsSchema,
  onParseError: (error) => {
    // Handle different error types
    if (error.type === 'storage_empty') {
      return { theme: 'light', notifications: true }; // default value
    }
    console.error('Settings parse error:', error);
    return { theme: 'light', notifications: true }; // fallback value
  }
});

// Use in component
$effect(() => {
  console.log('Current theme:', settings.value.theme);
});

// Update settings
settings.value = { theme: 'dark', notifications: false };
```

**Note:** For production use, consider wrapping the persisted state in an encapsulated pattern with controlled access methods. See [Encapsulated State Pattern](../../docs/patterns/encapsulated-state-pattern.md) for best practices.

#### API

```typescript
createPersistedState<TSchema extends StandardSchemaV1>(options: {
  key: string;
  schema: TSchema;
  onParseError: (error: ParseErrorReason<TSchema>) => StandardSchemaV1.InferOutput<TSchema>;
  onUpdateSuccess?: (newValue: StandardSchemaV1.InferOutput<TSchema>) => void;
  onUpdateError?: (error: unknown) => void;
  onUpdateSettled?: () => void;
})
```

#### Parameters

- **`key`**: The key used to store the value in local storage
- **`schema`**: A Standard Schema v1 compatible schema for validation
- **`onParseError`**: Handler called when the value from storage cannot be parsed or validated. Must return a valid default value.
- **`onUpdateSuccess`** (optional): Called when the value is successfully written to storage
- **`onUpdateError`** (optional): Called when writing to storage fails
- **`onUpdateSettled`** (optional): Called after update attempt completes (success or failure)

#### Error Types

The `onParseError` handler receives one of these error types:

- **`storage_empty`**: No value found in storage for the given key
- **`json_parse_error`**: Failed to parse the stored JSON string
- **`schema_validation_async_during_sync`**: Schema validation returned a Promise during synchronous parsing
- **`schema_validation_failed`**: Schema validation failed with specific issues

#### Example: Persisting Table State

```typescript
// Persist table sorting state
const sorting = createPersistedState({
  key: 'data-table-sorting',
  schema: z.array(z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    desc: z.boolean()
  })),
  onParseError: () => [{ id: 'created_at', desc: true }] // default sort
});

// Persist row selection
const rowSelection = createPersistedState({
  key: 'data-table-selection',
  schema: z.record(z.boolean()),
  onParseError: () => ({}) // no selection by default
});
```
